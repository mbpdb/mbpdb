QVVPYPQ	P05814	QVVPYPQ	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	182-188	Antioxidant						Identification of bioactive peptides after digestion of human milk and infant formula with pepsin and pancreatin	Hernandez-Ledesma, B. et al.	Seven human milks were subjected to an in vitro digestion with pepsin and pancreatin to identify the peptides released from human proteins. On the basis of their sequences, 11 of the 23 peptides were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities were measured. The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012	sequence	IDENTITY	100.00	1	7	1	7	9.83e-07	7	0	0

FFDPQIPK	P05814	PFFDPQIP	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	124-131	ACE-inhibitory		410.0				Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting Enzyme by Synthetic Peptides of Human β-Casein	Kohmura, M. et al.	The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY	87.50	1	7	2	8	2.17e-06	7	0	0

PFVEPIP	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Anticancer	decreased breastcancer cell proliferation					Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.87e-05	6	0	0
PFVEPIP	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Increase cellular growth	Promote beta-cell development					The protective effects of human milk-derived peptides on the pancreatic islet biology	Singh, A. et al.	Several epidemiological studies support the protective role of breastfeeding in reducing the risk for type 1 diabetes. Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants and contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this study, we examined the physiological effects of human milk-derived opioid peptides, β-casomorphins (BCM), and compared them with bovine-milk-derived opioid peptides on pancreatic hormone regulation and β-cell regeneration. Exposure of wild-type zebrafish embryos to 50 µg/ml of human BCM-5 and -7 from 3 days post fertilisation until 6 days post fertilisation resulted in an increased insulin domain of expression while exposure to bovine BCM-5 and -7 significantly reduced the insulin domain of expression as analysed by whole-mount in situ hybridisation. These changes may be accounted for by reduced insulin expression or β-cell number and were mitigated by the µ-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The effect of BCM on β-cell regeneration was assessed following ablation of β-cells in Tg (ins: CFP-NTR) zebrafish from 3 days post fertilisation to 4 days post fertilisation, followed by exposure of bovine and human BCM-5 and -7 (50 µg/ml) from 4 days post fertilisation until 7 days post fertilisation. The regenerative capacity of β-cells was not impeded following exposure to human BCM-5 and -7, whereas the capacity of β-cells to regenerate following bovine BCM-5 and -7 exposure was reduced. Our data suggest that human BCM-5 and -7 may promote β-cell development and enable the regeneration of β-cells, while the bovine-milk-derived peptides, BCM-5 and -7, play an opposite role. These data may provide some biological explanation for the protective effect of breastfeeding on the development of type 1 diabetes.	10.1242/bio.049304	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.87e-05	6	0	0
PFVEPIP	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Opioid						β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells	Plaisancie, P. et al.	We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.87e-05	6	0	0

Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.87e-05	6	0	0

2) The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.,
3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm.

The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.,
4) Physiological digestion plays a key role in the formation and degradation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a simulated gastrointestinal digestion on the stability of eight peptides previously identified in fermented milk with antihypertensive activity. Two of these identified peptides with sequences LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, possess ACE-inhibitory activity in vitro and antihypertensive activity in vivo. The results showed that LHLPLP was resistant to digestive enzymes. In contrast, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP was totally hydrolyzed and its activity decreased after incubation with pepsin and a pancreatic extract. The peptide LHLPLP was incubated with ACE and was found to be a true inhibitor of the enzyme and to exhibit a competitive inhibitor pattern. A structure-activity relationship study of this peptide was carried out by synthesizing several modified peptides related to the sequence LHLPLP. The substitution of amino acid Leu in the penultimate position by Gly improved the ACE-inhibitory activity twofold and the substitution of Pro at C-terminal position by Arg increased the activity twofold, with an IC50 of LHLPLR as low as 1.8 microM.,
5) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk."

LENLHLPLP	P02666	ENLHLPLPLL	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	146-155	ACE-inhibitory		250.0				Identification of Angiotensin-I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptides Derived from Sodium Caseinate Hydrolysates Produced by Lactobacillus helveticus NCC 2765	Robert, M-C. et al.	Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	80.00	2	9	1	8	1.64e-07	8	0	0

YPFVEPIP	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Anticancer	decreased breastcancer cell proliferation					Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	87.50	1	7	1	7	1.56e-06	7	0	0
YPFVEPIP	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Increase cellular growth	Promote beta-cell development					The protective effects of human milk-derived peptides on the pancreatic islet biology	Singh, A. et al.	Several epidemiological studies support the protective role of breastfeeding in reducing the risk for type 1 diabetes. Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants and contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this study, we examined the physiological effects of human milk-derived opioid peptides, β-casomorphins (BCM), and compared them with bovine-milk-derived opioid peptides on pancreatic hormone regulation and β-cell regeneration. Exposure of wild-type zebrafish embryos to 50 µg/ml of human BCM-5 and -7 from 3 days post fertilisation until 6 days post fertilisation resulted in an increased insulin domain of expression while exposure to bovine BCM-5 and -7 significantly reduced the insulin domain of expression as analysed by whole-mount in situ hybridisation. These changes may be accounted for by reduced insulin expression or β-cell number and were mitigated by the µ-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The effect of BCM on β-cell regeneration was assessed following ablation of β-cells in Tg (ins: CFP-NTR) zebrafish from 3 days post fertilisation to 4 days post fertilisation, followed by exposure of bovine and human BCM-5 and -7 (50 µg/ml) from 4 days post fertilisation until 7 days post fertilisation. The regenerative capacity of β-cells was not impeded following exposure to human BCM-5 and -7, whereas the capacity of β-cells to regenerate following bovine BCM-5 and -7 exposure was reduced. Our data suggest that human BCM-5 and -7 may promote β-cell development and enable the regeneration of β-cells, while the bovine-milk-derived peptides, BCM-5 and -7, play an opposite role. These data may provide some biological explanation for the protective effect of breastfeeding on the development of type 1 diabetes.	10.1242/bio.049304	sequence	IDENTITY	87.50	1	7	1	7	1.56e-06	7	0	0
YPFVEPIP	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Opioid						β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells	Plaisancie, P. et al.	We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	87.50	1	7	1	7	1.56e-06	7	0	0

LNQELLLNPTHQIYPV	P05814	LLNQELLLNPTHQIYPV	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	197-213	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli S. aureus Y. enterocolitica		Investigation into the antimicrobial action and mechanism of a novel endogenous peptide ?-casein 197 from human milk	Fu, Yanrong. et al.	A novel endogenous peptide cleaved from 197–213 AA of β-casein, named β-casein 197, was identified by tandem mass spectrometry. β-casein 197 constituted a significant proportion of the peptide content in preterm milk. This study investigated the antibacterial effects and mechanisms against common pathogenic bacteria. Six bacterial strains were selected for this study: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia and Bacillus subtilis. After synthesis, serial twofold dilutions of β-casein 197 were added to select for sensitive bacteria. The disk diffusion method and analysis of bacterial staining were used to identify antibacterial effect, while DNA-binding, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to explore antimicrobial mechanisms. Disk diffusion showed that E. coli, S. aureus and Y. enterocolitica were sensitive to the β-casein 197. In addition, live/dead fluorescent staining also confirmed antibacterial effects. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy revealed affected extracellular and intracellular structure for three species of bacteria, while a DNA-binding assay showed that the antimicrobial activity did not occur through DNA binding. This study suggests that β-casein 197 has antimicrobial activity against common pathogenic bacteria in newborns with infection. The peptide induced membrane permeabilization but did not bind to genomic DNA. Based on our findings, β-casein 197 has potential clinical value for preventing infections of premature infants.	10.1186/s13568-017-0409-y	sequence	IDENTITY	94.12	1	16	2	17	1.07e-17	16	0	0

The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides. Depending on dose and amino acid sequence, these five peptides were able to affect the expression of some virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium.	10.1007/s12602-022-09936-2	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	2	11	1	10	9.64e-08	10	1	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1	9	2	10	6.06e-09	9	0	0

Dallas, Yimin Chen	Human milk reduces risk for necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs in the ileocecal region where thousands of milk protein-derived peptides have been released from digestion. Digestion-released peptides may exert bioactivity, such as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, in the gut. In this study, we applied mass spectrometry-based peptidomics to characterize peptides present in colostrum before and after in vitro digestion. Sequence-based computational modeling was applied to predict peptides with antimicrobial activity. We identified more peptides in undigested samples, yet the abundances were much higher in the digested samples. Heatmapping demonstrated highly different peptide profiles between undigested and digested samples. Four peptides (αS1-casein [157–163], αS1-casein [157–165], β-casein [153–159] and plasminogen [591–597]) were selected, synthesized and tested against common pathogenic bacteria associated with necrotizing enterocolitis.

Dallas, Yimin Chen	Human milk reduces risk for necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs in the ileocecal region where thousands of milk protein-derived peptides have been released from digestion. Digestion-released peptides may exert bioactivity, such as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, in the gut. In this study, we applied mass spectrometry-based peptidomics to characterize peptides present in colostrum before and after in vitro digestion. Sequence-based computational modeling was applied to predict peptides with antimicrobial activity. We identified more peptides in undigested samples, yet the abundances were much higher in the digested samples. Heatmapping demonstrated highly different peptide profiles between undigested and digested samples. Four peptides (αS1-casein [157–163], αS1-casein [157–165], β-casein [153–159] and plasminogen [591–597]) were selected, synthesized and tested against common pathogenic bacteria associated with necrotizing enterocolitis.

IYPFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Anticancer	decreased breastcancer cell proliferation					Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	87.50	2	8	1	7	1.56e-06	7	0	0
IYPFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Increase cellular growth	Promote beta-cell development					The protective effects of human milk-derived peptides on the pancreatic islet biology	Singh, A. et al.	Several epidemiological studies support the protective role of breastfeeding in reducing the risk for type 1 diabetes. Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants and contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this study, we examined the physiological effects of human milk-derived opioid peptides, β-casomorphins (BCM), and compared them with bovine-milk-derived opioid peptides on pancreatic hormone regulation and β-cell regeneration. Exposure of wild-type zebrafish embryos to 50 µg/ml of human BCM-5 and -7 from 3 days post fertilisation until 6 days post fertilisation resulted in an increased insulin domain of expression while exposure to bovine BCM-5 and -7 significantly reduced the insulin domain of expression as analysed by whole-mount in situ hybridisation. These changes may be accounted for by reduced insulin expression or β-cell number and were mitigated by the µ-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The effect of BCM on β-cell regeneration was assessed following ablation of β-cells in Tg (ins: CFP-NTR) zebrafish from 3 days post fertilisation to 4 days post fertilisation, followed by exposure of bovine and human BCM-5 and -7 (50 µg/ml) from 4 days post fertilisation until 7 days post fertilisation. The regenerative capacity of β-cells was not impeded following exposure to human BCM-5 and -7, whereas the capacity of β-cells to regenerate following bovine BCM-5 and -7 exposure was reduced. Our data suggest that human BCM-5 and -7 may promote β-cell development and enable the regeneration of β-cells, while the bovine-milk-derived peptides, BCM-5 and -7, play an opposite role. These data may provide some biological explanation for the protective effect of breastfeeding on the development of type 1 diabetes.	10.1242/bio.049304	sequence	IDENTITY	87.50	2	8	1	7	1.56e-06	7	0	0
IYPFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Opioid						β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells	Plaisancie, P. et al.	We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	87.50	2	8	1	7	1.56e-06	7	0	0

The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	1	10	1	10	2.88e-10	10	0	0

The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides. Depending on dose and amino acid sequence, these five peptides were able to affect the expression of some virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium.	10.1007/s12602-022-09936-2	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	12	1	11	4.16e-09	11	1	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155).

NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	2	10	2	10	9.36e-09	9	0	0

DLENLHLPLPL	P02666	ENLHLPLPLL	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	146-155	ACE-inhibitory		250.0				Identification of Angiotensin-I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptides Derived from Sodium Caseinate Hydrolysates Produced by Lactobacillus helveticus NCC 2765	Robert, M-C. et al.	Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	3	11	1	9	1.03e-08	9	0	0
DLENLHLPLPL	P02666	DVENLHLPLPL	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	144-154	Antimicrobial						Modulation of Virulence Gene Expression in Salmonella enterica subsp enterica typhimurium by Synthetic Milk-Derived Peptides	Ali, E. et al.	The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides. Depending on dose and amino acid sequence, these five peptides were able to affect the expression of some virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium.	10.1007/s12602-022-09936-2	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	1	11	1	11	2.89e-09	11	1	0

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.87e-05	6	0	0
IYPFVEP	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Increase cellular growth	Promote beta-cell development					The protective effects of human milk-derived peptides on the pancreatic islet biology	Singh, A. et al.	Several epidemiological studies support the protective role of breastfeeding in reducing the risk for type 1 diabetes. Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants and contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this study, we examined the physiological effects of human milk-derived opioid peptides, β-casomorphins (BCM), and compared them with bovine-milk-derived opioid peptides on pancreatic hormone regulation and β-cell regeneration. Exposure of wild-type zebrafish embryos to 50 µg/ml of human BCM-5 and -7 from 3 days post fertilisation until 6 days post fertilisation resulted in an increased insulin domain of expression while exposure to bovine BCM-5 and -7 significantly reduced the insulin domain of expression as analysed by whole-mount in situ hybridisation. These changes may be accounted for by reduced insulin expression or β-cell number and were mitigated by the µ-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The effect of BCM on β-cell regeneration was assessed following ablation of β-cells in Tg (ins: CFP-NTR) zebrafish from 3 days post fertilisation to 4 days post fertilisation, followed by exposure of bovine and human BCM-5 and -7 (50 µg/ml) from 4 days post fertilisation until 7 days post fertilisation. The regenerative capacity of β-cells was not impeded following exposure to human BCM-5 and -7, whereas the capacity of β-cells to regenerate following bovine BCM-5 and -7 exposure was reduced. Our data suggest that human BCM-5 and -7 may promote β-cell development and enable the regeneration of β-cells, while the bovine-milk-derived peptides, BCM-5 and -7, play an opposite role. These data may provide some biological explanation for the protective effect of breastfeeding on the development of type 1 diabetes.	10.1242/bio.049304	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.87e-05	6	0	0
IYPFVEP	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Opioid						β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells	Plaisancie, P. et al.	We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.87e-05	6	0	0

Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.78e-05	6	0	0

LTDLENLH	P05814	LTDLENLHLP	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	133-142	ACE-inhibitory						Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by synthetic peptides of human β-casein	Kohmura, M. et al.	The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY	80.00	1	8	1	8	1.05e-07	8	0	0

VVLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	ACE-inhibitory		15.0				Transepithelial transport of milk derived bioactive peptide VLPVPQK	Vij, R. et al.	The transepithelial transport of an antioxidative and ACE inhibitory peptide, VLPVPQK (named peptide C) derived from casein hydrolysates was investigated along with extensively studied opioid peptide β-casomorphin using a human intestinal cell (Caco-2) monolayer. The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.121	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.87e-05	6	0	0
VVLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antiapoptotic effect						 Anti-apoptotic effect of buffalo milk casein-derived bioactive peptide by directing Nrf2 regulation in starving fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Starvation conditions cause cell injury or ulcers from reactive oxygen species generation and, ultimately, lead to cell death or apoptosis. Milk has many bioactive peptides with cytoprotective potential. One such peptide is the buffalo milk β-casein derived antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. It was found to have cytoprotective action during oxidative stress. However, the protective role of the peptide in natural aging induced apoptosis has not been studied. In the present study, the anti-apoptotic effect of the peptide was analyzed by establishing an in vitro model of skin fibroblast cells with serum starved conditions similar to aging. Cell survivability and cytotoxicity were measured using MTT and LDH assays, respectively. Cell death rate was determined using propidium iodide staining. In addition, gene level expression of anti-apoptotic markers’ such as Nrf2, Keap-1, Bcl-2, Bax and HO-1 were analyzed using quantitative real time-PCR. While nuclear transmigration of Nrf2 at the protein level was analyzed using western blots. The peptide treatment led to inhibition of cell death as observed using PI, DCFH-DA staining and improvement in cell survival through the activation of transcription factor, Nrf2. The activation of Nrf2 stimulated the expression of cytoprotective signals from HO-1. Moreover, the peptide augmented the cellular protection by inhibiting the expression of the Nrf2 inhibitor (Keap1), pro-apoptotic markers (Bax) and stimulating anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) gene expression. In addition, a pronounced reduction in the activity of the cell injury marker, LDH was observed. Hence, this study showed that the antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK also showed an anti-apoptotic effect.	10.1016/j.fbio.2020.100566	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.87e-05	6	0	0
VVLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antimicrobial				Gram negative		Isolation and identification of some antibacterial peptides in the plasmin-digest of β-casein	Sedaghati, H. et al.	This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.87e-05	6	0	0

2) Devi, S. et al."	"1) Bioactive peptides have been defined as specific protein fragments that have a positive impact on body functions or conditions and may ultimately influence health. We scrutinised the antioxidative property of peptides from buffalo casein digested with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin alone and in combinations. Casein hydrolysates were subjected to ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The antioxidant properties of casein, its hydrolysates and synthetic peptides, was assessed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid). The fraction with highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) was selected for further study. TEAC of casein was 0.862 ± 0.11 μmol mg−1, while it is highest for pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates. The 1 kDa permeate of pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates possessed the highest antioxidant activity and it was resolved into 16 fractions by RP-HPLC. Antioxidant activity fraction 11 was highest and on custom sequencing yielded 4 peptides, of which the synthetic peptide VLPVPQK possessed the highest TEAC (5.71 ± 0.59 μmol mg−1).,
2) In the recent time, demand for nontoxic antioxidative substances such as peptides has boomed among pharmacologists. In the present investigation, peptides, VLPVPQ and VLPVP were generated from parent antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. Initially, all these peptides were studied in-silico for biophysical properties like hydrophobicity, structure, Extinction coefficient, isoelectric point, grand average hydropathy value and Wimley White whole residue hydrophobicity. Inspite of this, homology relationship among organisms, taxonomy, digestibility assessment for proteases, solubility, melting temperature index, half-life time in-vitro and in-vivo, instability index and aliphatic index was compared in-silico. Further, based on these properties, VLPVP was compared with parent peptide, VLPVPQK for antioxidative potential. VLPVP exhibited lesser antioxidative potential by chemical method and in-vitro hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress conditions generated in fibroblast cells compared to VLPVPQK. The proliferative potential, cell injury marker, nitric oxide production and pro-inflammatory, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α was measured to compare cytoprotective antioxidative potential. The results displayed the cytoprotective potential of VLPVPQK. In addition, the present study suggested that glutamine and lysine are responsible for the c-terminal sequence based response and cytoprotective potential of milk bioactive peptide, VLPVPQK. Other than this, hydrophobic amino acids and positive charge of the VLPVPQK is also responsible for the cytoprotective potential."	"1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2014.11.001,

2) Repertoire of Structure-Activity-Based Novel Modified Peptides Elicits Enhanced Osteogenic Potential"	"1) Reddi, S. et al.,
2) Upadhyay, D. et al."	"1) Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.,
2) Biologically active peptides in milk proteins can be used as effective dietary supplements for management of bone-associated issues including osteoporosis. A bioactive peptide derived from milk, viz. VLPVPQK/PepC, has been validated previously from our lab for its osteoanabolic action. In this study, we report 14 novel variants of PepC, designed in silico, based on the structure–activity relationship, aiming to enhance its osteogenic effect that holds tremendous therapeutic utility for bone-related injuries. PepC was computationally modified at seven positions of its original sequence, resulting in 14 modified synthetic peptides for functional predictions and in vitro assessment by comparative analysis of modified peptides by PepC for improved ability in osteogenic functional assays (proliferation potential, antioxidant ability, gene and protein expression, cytotoxic effect, bone mineralization) using calvarial osteoblasts. For most peptides with the highest Peptide7 response relative to PepC (p < 0.05), enhanced osteoanabolic response was observed. Further observations on Peptide7 have therefore been investigated in depth (qPCR, immunoblotting, LCMS/MS, and PCA analysis). Peptide7 displayed a rise in the expression of osteogenes (Osterix, Opg, Bmp2, and Runx2, p < 0.05) and protein (Runx2 and Bmp2, p < 0.05). Besides, LCMS/MS findings suggest Peptide7 escapes intestinal peptidases degradation. Experimental evidence supports an improved osteological reaction to newly modified peptides and hence exploitation in the preparation of functional foods or supplements."

VVLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Wound healing						Nrf2 dependent antiaging effect of milk derived bioactive peptide in old fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Prolonged passaging of primary fibroblast cells totally shapes the natural biological phenomena and leads to the appearance of features related to senescence. As a result, it is a good natural tool to delineate the molecular mechanism of cellular aging. The present investigation revealed the antiaging effect of milk-derived novel bioactive peptide (VLPVPQK). The peptide played an important role in downregulating apoptosis-related markers in late passages of cultured fibroblast cells. The peptide treatment to aged fibroblasts caused enhancement in cell migration, DNA integrity, and decrease in the lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide production as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, the peptide decreased the expression of apoptotic caspases, Bax, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) proteins. The peptide pretreatment also enhanced the extracellular collagen protein and antiapoptotic, Bcl-xL. In addition, the peptide treatment reversed the senescence-related activity in fibroblasts by stimulating Nrf2 mediated antioxidative defense system and inhibiting the action of NFkB/p38MAPK signaling, similar to the commercially available inhibitor (SB203580) of p38MAPK. Thus, the peptide exhibits the antiaging effect in dermal fibroblast cells.	10.1002/jcb.28246	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.87e-05	6	0	0

Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.,
2) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.,
3) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins or artificial synthetic products. Further research examining the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods.

The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	2	7	3.87e-05	6	0	0
VVLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQ	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-190	Cholesterol regulation	Inhibition of cholesterol solubility					Novel milk casein derived peptides decrease cholesterol micellar solubility and cholesterol intestinal absorption in Caco-2 cells	Jiang, X. et al.	This study sought to assess the cholesterol-lowering activity of peptides obtained from milk casein hydrolyzed with neutrase. The bioactive peptides were separated using a Sephadex G-10 chromatographic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) after ultrafiltration using a 1-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we determined that peptides Thr-Asp-Val-Glu-Asn [TDVEN; β-casein f(143–147)], Leu-Gln-Pro-Glu [LQPE; β-casein f(103–106)], Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu [VAPFPE; αS1-casein f(40–45)], and Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln [VLPVPQ β-casein f(185–190)] reduced micellar cholesterol solubility. After Caco-2 cells were treated with LQPE, VLPVPQ, and VAPFPE, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein levels decreased by (means ± SEM) 19.33 ± 2.47%, 52.1 ± 3.77%, and 23.09 ± 8.52%, respectively, compared with the control group. Treatment with each peptide induced significant upregulation of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8 antibody (ABCG8) mRNA expression by 398.1 ± 23.27%, 86.4 ± 27.07%, and 92.8 ± 8.49%. We found that VLPVPQ and LQPE significantly upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transcription by 203.9 ± 8.44% and 220.8 ± 36.42% respectively, whereas VLPVPQ significantly decreased mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) and microsomal triacylglycerols (MTP). The cholesterol-lowering action of milk-derived peptides may be induced by suppression of micellar cholesterol solubility and affects the expression of cholesterol absorption–related proteins and enzymes in intestinal epithelial cells. This research discovers new milk-derived peptides with decreasing cholesterol micellar solubility and provides a theoretical basis of in vitro cholesterol-lowering effects of peptides.	10.3168/jds.2019-17586	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.78e-05	6	0	0

LPQNILP	P02666	LPQNIPP	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	85-91	DPP-IV Inhibitory		160.0				Isolation and identification of casein-derived dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory peptide LPQNIPPL from gouda-type cheese and its effect on plasma glucose in rats	Uenishi, H. et al.	A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	7	1	7	2.89e-04	7	1	0

NLHLPLPL	P02666	NLHLPLPLL	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	147-155	ACE-inhibitory		15.0				Identification of Angiotensin-I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitory Peptides Derived from Sodium Caseinate Hydrolysates Produced by Lactobacillus helveticus NCC 2765	Robert, M-C. et al.	Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	8	1	8	7.83e-08	8	0	0

Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	87.50	2	8	1	7	1.56e-06	7	0	0

PFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Anticancer	decreased breastcancer cell proliferation					Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	2.39e-05	6	0	0
PFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Increase cellular growth	Promote beta-cell development					The protective effects of human milk-derived peptides on the pancreatic islet biology	Singh, A. et al.	Several epidemiological studies support the protective role of breastfeeding in reducing the risk for type 1 diabetes. Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants and contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this study, we examined the physiological effects of human milk-derived opioid peptides, β-casomorphins (BCM), and compared them with bovine-milk-derived opioid peptides on pancreatic hormone regulation and β-cell regeneration. Exposure of wild-type zebrafish embryos to 50 µg/ml of human BCM-5 and -7 from 3 days post fertilisation until 6 days post fertilisation resulted in an increased insulin domain of expression while exposure to bovine BCM-5 and -7 significantly reduced the insulin domain of expression as analysed by whole-mount in situ hybridisation. These changes may be accounted for by reduced insulin expression or β-cell number and were mitigated by the µ-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The effect of BCM on β-cell regeneration was assessed following ablation of β-cells in Tg (ins: CFP-NTR) zebrafish from 3 days post fertilisation to 4 days post fertilisation, followed by exposure of bovine and human BCM-5 and -7 (50 µg/ml) from 4 days post fertilisation until 7 days post fertilisation. The regenerative capacity of β-cells was not impeded following exposure to human BCM-5 and -7, whereas the capacity of β-cells to regenerate following bovine BCM-5 and -7 exposure was reduced. Our data suggest that human BCM-5 and -7 may promote β-cell development and enable the regeneration of β-cells, while the bovine-milk-derived peptides, BCM-5 and -7, play an opposite role. These data may provide some biological explanation for the protective effect of breastfeeding on the development of type 1 diabetes.	10.1242/bio.049304	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	2.39e-05	6	0	0
PFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Opioid						β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells	Plaisancie, P. et al.	We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	2.39e-05	6	0	0

The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	6	1	5	6.98e-04	5	0	0

Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals.

Dallas, Yimin Chen	Human milk reduces risk for necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs in the ileocecal region where thousands of milk protein-derived peptides have been released from digestion. Digestion-released peptides may exert bioactivity, such as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, in the gut. In this study, we applied mass spectrometry-based peptidomics to characterize peptides present in colostrum before and after in vitro digestion. Sequence-based computational modeling was applied to predict peptides with antimicrobial activity. We identified more peptides in undigested samples, yet the abundances were much higher in the digested samples. Heatmapping demonstrated highly different peptide profiles between undigested and digested samples. Four peptides (αS1-casein [157–163], αS1-casein [157–165], β-casein [153–159] and plasminogen [591–597]) were selected, synthesized and tested against common pathogenic bacteria associated with necrotizing enterocolitis. All four exhibited bacteriostatic, though not bactericidal, activities against Klebsiella aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens, but not Escherichia coli.	10.3390/nu16132040	sequence	IDENTITY	87.50	2	8	1	7	1.56e-06	7	0	0

Seven human milks were subjected to an in vitro digestion with pepsin and pancreatin to identify the peptides released from human proteins. On the basis of their sequences, 11 of the 23 peptides were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities were measured. The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk.

VVPYPQ	P05814	VPYPQ	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	184-188	Antioxidant						Novel anti-oxidative peptides from enzymatic digestion of human milk	Tsopmo, A. et al.	Human milk pepsin and pancreatin digests were separated using molecular membrane and reverse phase chromatography. Chemical screening of the resulting fractions using the ORAC antioxidant assay yielded a peptide fraction (PF-23) with high antioxidant activity (5207 μM Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g). Tandem mass spectrometry allowed the identification of twenty peptides. Eight small molecular weight peptides from 4 to 6 amino acids were synthesised and screened for antioxidant properties using ORAC and linoleic acid emulsion. On ORAC, the peptides YGYTGA (5169 μM TE/mmol) and ISELGW (4479 μM TE/mmol) were the most active. At 250 μM peptide ISELGW and its derivatives significantly reduced hydroperoxides formed during autoxidation of linoleic acid for 4 days at 50 °C. Further testing of these peptides may allow their inclusion in infant formulas to reduce the incidence of oxidative stress-mediated diseases in newborns.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.146	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	6	1	5	5.02e-04	5	0	0
VVPYPQ	P05814	VPYPQ	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	184-188	DPP-IV Inhibitory		41.45				In Vitro Metabolic Stability of a Casein-Derived Dipeptidyl Peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) Inhibitory Peptide VPYPQ and Its Controlled Release from Casein by Enzymatic Hydrolysis	L.Zheng. et al.	The aim of this study was to investigate the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibition and metabolic stability of a casein-derived peptide Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln (VPYPQ) and its fragments as well as their release from casein following hydrolysis. Results showed that VPYPQ was the most potent DPP-IV inhibitory peptide among them with an IC50 value of 41.45 μM. This might be due to its two internal Pro residues at positions 2 and 4. Moreover, VPYPQ was resistant to hydrolysis by gastrointestinal enzymes and was relatively more stable to hydrolysis by DPP-IV and peptidases in plasma compared with its fragments. Additionally, oral administration of VPYPQ at a dose of 90 μmol/kg body weight could reduce the postprandial blood glucose levels in mice. More importantly, VPYPQ could be released efficiently from casein following hydrolysis by a combination of papain and in vitro digestion, reaching up to 3211.15 μg/g. Therefore, VPYPQ was a promising casein-derived DPP-IV inhibitor.	10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03164	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	6	1	5	5.02e-04	5	0	0

VVPYPQ	P02666	VPYPQR	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	193-198	Antioxidant						 Insight into antioxidant properties of milk derived bioactive peptides in vitro and in a cellular model	Tonolo, F. et al.	Milk is a nutritionally important source of bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. These compounds can be useful as ingredients of functional food. For this reason, in the last decades, bioactive peptides attracted the interest of researchers and food companies. In this work, the results obtained with six milk-derived bioactive peptides (Y-4-R, V-6-R, V-7-K, A-10-F, R-10-M, and H-9-M) synthesized and studied for their antioxidant properties in vitro and in a cellular model, are reported. These molecules correspond to peptide fragments derived from parent compounds able to cross the apical membrane of Caco-2 cell layer and released in the basolateral compartment. In vitro, antioxidant tests such as 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and crocin bleaching showed antioxidant activity mainly for peptides Y-4-R and V-6-R, respectively. In Caco-2 cells, peptides V-6-R, H-9-R, Y-4-R, and particularly R-10-M and V-7-K are able to prevent the decrease of viability due to oxidative stress. The latter peptide is also the most effective in protecting cells from lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, the reported hydrolyzed peptides are shown to exert the antioxidant properties both in vitro and in a cellular model.	10.1002/psc.3162	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	6	1	5	6.98e-04	5	0	0

This study sought to assess the cholesterol-lowering activity of peptides obtained from milk casein hydrolyzed with neutrase. The bioactive peptides were separated using a Sephadex G-10 chromatographic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) after ultrafiltration using a 1-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we determined that peptides Thr-Asp-Val-Glu-Asn [TDVEN; β-casein f(143–147)], Leu-Gln-Pro-Glu [LQPE; β-casein f(103–106)], Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu [VAPFPE; αS1-casein f(40–45)], and Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln [VLPVPQ β-casein f(185–190)] reduced micellar cholesterol solubility. After Caco-2 cells were treated with LQPE, VLPVPQ, and VAPFPE, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein levels decreased by (means ± SEM) 19.33 ± 2.47%, 52.1 ± 3.77%, and 23.09 ± 8.52%, respectively, compared with the control group. Treatment with each peptide induced significant upregulation of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8 antibody (ABCG8) mRNA expression by 398.1 ± 23.27%, 86.4 ± 27.07%, and 92.8 ± 8.49%. We found that VLPVPQ and LQPE significantly upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transcription by 203.9 ± 8.44% and 220.8 ± 36.42% respectively, whereas VLPVPQ significantly decreased mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) and microsomal triacylglycerols (MTP). The cholesterol-lowering action of milk-derived peptides may be induced by suppression of micellar cholesterol solubility and affects the expression of cholesterol absorption–related proteins and enzymes in intestinal epithelial cells. This research discovers new milk-derived peptides with decreasing cholesterol micellar solubility and provides a theoretical basis of in vitro cholesterol-lowering effects of peptides.	10.3168/jds.2019-17586	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	6	1	6	0.005	6	1	0

The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012	sequence	IDENTITY	100.00	1	7	1	7	9.83e-07	7	0	0

2) Milk-derived bioactive peptides exhibit antioxidant activity through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway"	"1) Tsopmo, A. et al.,
2) Tonolo, F. et al."	"1) Human milk pepsin and pancreatin digests were separated using molecular membrane and reverse phase chromatography. Chemical screening of the resulting fractions using the ORAC antioxidant assay yielded a peptide fraction (PF-23) with high antioxidant activity (5207 μM Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g). Tandem mass spectrometry allowed the identification of twenty peptides. Eight small molecular weight peptides from 4 to 6 amino acids were synthesised and screened for antioxidant properties using ORAC and linoleic acid emulsion. On ORAC, the peptides YGYTGA (5169 μM TE/mmol) and ISELGW (4479 μM TE/mmol) were the most active. At 250 μM peptide ISELGW and its derivatives significantly reduced hydroperoxides formed during autoxidation of linoleic acid for 4 days at 50 °C. Further testing of these peptides may allow their inclusion in infant formulas to reduce the incidence of oxidative stress-mediated diseases in newborns.,
2) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway."	"1) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.146,

YPFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Anticancer	decreased breastcancer cell proliferation					Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	100.00	1	7	1	7	9.83e-07	7	0	0
YPFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Increase cellular growth	Promote beta-cell development					The protective effects of human milk-derived peptides on the pancreatic islet biology	Singh, A. et al.	Several epidemiological studies support the protective role of breastfeeding in reducing the risk for type 1 diabetes. Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants and contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this study, we examined the physiological effects of human milk-derived opioid peptides, β-casomorphins (BCM), and compared them with bovine-milk-derived opioid peptides on pancreatic hormone regulation and β-cell regeneration. Exposure of wild-type zebrafish embryos to 50 µg/ml of human BCM-5 and -7 from 3 days post fertilisation until 6 days post fertilisation resulted in an increased insulin domain of expression while exposure to bovine BCM-5 and -7 significantly reduced the insulin domain of expression as analysed by whole-mount in situ hybridisation. These changes may be accounted for by reduced insulin expression or β-cell number and were mitigated by the µ-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The effect of BCM on β-cell regeneration was assessed following ablation of β-cells in Tg (ins: CFP-NTR) zebrafish from 3 days post fertilisation to 4 days post fertilisation, followed by exposure of bovine and human BCM-5 and -7 (50 µg/ml) from 4 days post fertilisation until 7 days post fertilisation. The regenerative capacity of β-cells was not impeded following exposure to human BCM-5 and -7, whereas the capacity of β-cells to regenerate following bovine BCM-5 and -7 exposure was reduced. Our data suggest that human BCM-5 and -7 may promote β-cell development and enable the regeneration of β-cells, while the bovine-milk-derived peptides, BCM-5 and -7, play an opposite role.

We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	100.00	1	7	1	7	9.83e-07	7	0	0
YPFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEP	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-71	ACE-inhibitory		7.48				In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.78e-05	6	0	0

Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	24	4	27	3.11e-27	24	0	0
