QVVPYPQ	P05814	QVVPYPQ	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	182-188	Antioxidant						Identification of bioactive peptides after digestion of human milk and infant formula with pepsin and pancreatin	Hernandez-Ledesma, B. et al.	Seven human milks were subjected to an in vitro digestion with pepsin and pancreatin to identify the peptides released from human proteins. On the basis of their sequences, 11 of the 23 peptides were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities were measured. The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012	sequence	IDENTITY

NLHLPLP	P05814	NLHLPLP	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	138-144	ACE-inhibitory		51.0				Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting Enzyme by Synthetic Peptides of Human β-Casein	Kohmura, M. et al.	The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY

Dallas, Yimin Chen	Human milk reduces risk for necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs in the ileocecal region where thousands of milk protein-derived peptides have been released from digestion. Digestion-released peptides may exert bioactivity, such as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, in the gut. In this study, we applied mass spectrometry-based peptidomics to characterize peptides present in colostrum before and after in vitro digestion. Sequence-based computational modeling was applied to predict peptides with antimicrobial activity. We identified more peptides in undigested samples, yet the abundances were much higher in the digested samples. Heatmapping demonstrated highly different peptide profiles between undigested and digested samples. Four peptides (αS1-casein [157–163], αS1-casein [157–165], β-casein [153–159] and plasminogen [591–597]) were selected, synthesized and tested against common pathogenic bacteria associated with necrotizing enterocolitis. All four exhibited bacteriostatic, though not bactericidal, activities against Klebsiella aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens, but not Escherichia coli.	10.3390/nu16132040	sequence	IDENTITY

The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY

Seven human milks were subjected to an in vitro digestion with pepsin and pancreatin to identify the peptides released from human proteins. On the basis of their sequences, 11 of the 23 peptides were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities were measured. The β-casein peptides HLPLP and WSVPQPK showed potent ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activity, with a protein concentration needed to inhibit 50% ACE activity (IC50) of 21 μm and a Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) of 1.297 μmol 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivs μmol−1 of peptide, respectively. These activities were determined after digestion of eight infant formulas and compared with those found in digested human milk. One of the infant formulas exhibited a low IC50 value (60.11 μg protein mL−1 of reconstituted formula) and a high TEAC value (1.7056 μmol Trolox equivs mg−1 of protein) and was therefore selected to identify the peptides responsible of these activities.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.012	sequence	IDENTITY

Dallas, Yimin Chen	Human milk reduces risk for necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs in the ileocecal region where thousands of milk protein-derived peptides have been released from digestion. Digestion-released peptides may exert bioactivity, such as antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities, in the gut. In this study, we applied mass spectrometry-based peptidomics to characterize peptides present in colostrum before and after in vitro digestion. Sequence-based computational modeling was applied to predict peptides with antimicrobial activity. We identified more peptides in undigested samples, yet the abundances were much higher in the digested samples. Heatmapping demonstrated highly different peptide profiles between undigested and digested samples. Four peptides (αS1-casein [157–163], αS1-casein [157–165], β-casein [153–159] and plasminogen [591–597]) were selected, synthesized and tested against common pathogenic bacteria associated with necrotizing enterocolitis. All four exhibited bacteriostatic, though not bactericidal, activities against Klebsiella aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens, but not Escherichia coli.	10.3390/nu16132040	sequence	IDENTITY

YPFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Anticancer	decreased breastcancer cell proliferation					Antiproliferative and receptor binding properties of α- and β-casomorphins in the T47D human breast cancer cell line	Hatzoglou, A. et al.	In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY
YPFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Increase cellular growth	Promote beta-cell development					The protective effects of human milk-derived peptides on the pancreatic islet biology	Singh, A. et al.	Several epidemiological studies support the protective role of breastfeeding in reducing the risk for type 1 diabetes. Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition for infants and contains many complex proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. In this study, we examined the physiological effects of human milk-derived opioid peptides, β-casomorphins (BCM), and compared them with bovine-milk-derived opioid peptides on pancreatic hormone regulation and β-cell regeneration. Exposure of wild-type zebrafish embryos to 50 µg/ml of human BCM-5 and -7 from 3 days post fertilisation until 6 days post fertilisation resulted in an increased insulin domain of expression while exposure to bovine BCM-5 and -7 significantly reduced the insulin domain of expression as analysed by whole-mount in situ hybridisation. These changes may be accounted for by reduced insulin expression or β-cell number and were mitigated by the µ-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone. The effect of BCM on β-cell regeneration was assessed following ablation of β-cells in Tg (ins: CFP-NTR) zebrafish from 3 days post fertilisation to 4 days post fertilisation, followed by exposure of bovine and human BCM-5 and -7 (50 µg/ml) from 4 days post fertilisation until 7 days post fertilisation. The regenerative capacity of β-cells was not impeded following exposure to human BCM-5 and -7, whereas the capacity of β-cells to regenerate following bovine BCM-5 and -7 exposure was reduced. Our data suggest that human BCM-5 and -7 may promote β-cell development and enable the regeneration of β-cells, while the bovine-milk-derived peptides, BCM-5 and -7, play an opposite role. These data may provide some biological explanation for the protective effect of breastfeeding on the development of type 1 diabetes.	10.1242/bio.049304	sequence	IDENTITY
YPFVEPI	P05814	YPFVEPI	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	66-72	Opioid						β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells	Plaisancie, P. et al.	We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY
