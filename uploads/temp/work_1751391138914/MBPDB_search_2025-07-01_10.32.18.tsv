RETIESLSSSEESITE	P05814	RETIESLSSSEESITEYK	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	16-33	Increase cellular growth	DNA synthesis					DNA-synthesis stimulating peptides from human β-casein	Azuma, N. et al.	DNA-synthesis stimulatory activity was found in some tryptic fragments of human /¡-casein by using BALB/c3T3 cells, and two of them were identified as the /¡-casein fragments of Arg[l] to Lys[18] (/¡-CN(f 1 -18)) and of Gln[105] to Lys[l 17] (/¡-CN(fl05 -117)).	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869716	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	16	1	16	1.45e-17	16	0	0
