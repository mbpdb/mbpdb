P02668	YIPIQYVLSR	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	46-55	Immunomodulatory	C3a Receptors agonist					Identification of Casoxin C, An Ileum-contracting Peptide Derived From Bovine kappa-casein, as an Agonist for C3a Receptors	Takahashi, M. et al.	Takahashi, M., S. Moriguchi, H. Suganuma, A. Shiota, F. Tani, H. Usui, K. Kurahashi, R. Sasaki and M. Yoshikawa. Identification of casoxin C, an ileum-contracting peptide derived from bovine κ-casein, as an agonist for C3a receptors. Peptides 18(3) 329-336, 1997.—Casoxin C (Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg) is a bioactive peptide that was isolated from a tryptic digest of bovine κ-casein as an anti-opioid peptide in longitudinal strips of guinea pig ileum. Casoxin C also evokes contraction of the ileal strips, and we found that this process was biphasic with rapid and slow components. The contractile profile was very similar to that of human complement C3a(70-77), which is the COOH-terminal octapeptide of C3a and has, although less potent, qualitatively the same biological activities as C3a. Casoxin C also has homology with C3a(70-77). The rapid contraction was mediated by histamine release and the slow contraction was mediated by a prostaglandin E2-like substance, judging from the effects of various pharmacological inhibitors and antagonists on the ileal contraction. Casoxin C had affinity for C3a receptors (IC50 = 40 μM) in the radioreceptor assay. In addition, casoxin C showed phagocyte-stimulating activities. Casoxin C is therefore the first milk-derived peptide identified, that acts through complement C3a receptors.	10.1016/s0196-9781(97)00044-2
P02754	WYSL	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	35-38	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Isolation and characterization of anti-inflammatory peptides derived from whey protein	Ma, Y. et al.	The present study was conducted to isolate and characterize anti-inflammatory peptides from whey protein hydrolysates using alcalase. Nine subfractions were obtained after sequential purification by ultrafiltration, Sephadex G-25 gel (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) filtration chromatography, and preparative HPLC. Among them, subfraction F4e showed the strongest inhibitory activity on interleukin-1β (IL-1β), cyclooxygenase-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA expression in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. Eight peptides, including 2 new peptides—Asp-Tyr-Lys-Lys-Tyr (DYKKY) and Asp-Gln-Trp-Leu (DQWL)—were identified from subfractions F4c and F4e, respectively, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Peptide DQWL showed the strongest inhibitory ability on IL-1β, cyclooxygenase-2, and TNF-α mRNA expression and production of IL-1β and TNF-α proteins at concentrations of 10 and 100 μg/mL, respectively. Additionally, DQWL treatment significantly inhibited nuclear factor-κB activation by suppressing nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB p65 and blocking inhibitor κB kinase phosphorylation and inhibitor κB degradation together with p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Our study suggests that peptide DQWL has anti-inflammatory potential; further confirmation using an in vivo model is needed.	10.3168/jds.2016-11186

P02666	YPFPGPI	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Immunomodulatory	induce inflammatory immune response in gut					Consumption of β-casomorphins-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in mice gut through Th-2 pathway	Ul Haq, MR. et al.	β-Casomorphins are opioid like bioactive peptides released on digestion of β-casein of milk. In the present study in vivo impact of consumption of β-casomorphins (BCM-7/5) was evaluated on immune response of murine gut. The peptides were given to mice through oral intubation at a dose of 7.5 × 10−8 mol/day/animal for 15 days. Oral administration of both peptides individually increased (p <0.01) phenotypic expression of inflammation associated molecules (MPO, MCP-1, IL-4 and histamine), humoral immune response (IgE, IgG, IgG1/IgG2a), infiltration of leucocytes in intestinal villi and mRNA expression of toll like receptors (TLR-2 and TLR-4) in mice gut. However, no changes in sIgA, IgA+ and goblet cell numbers were recorded. These results clearly indicate that consumption of β-casein derived peptides BCM-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in gut, most likely through Th2 pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.03.018
P02666	QEPVL	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	209-213	Immunomodulatory						Immunomodulating effects of casein-derived peptides QEPVL and QEPV on lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo	Jiehui, Z. et al.	Lymphocytes serve an important function in mediating specific immune responses. When the body is stimulated by internal or external antigens, activated lymphocytes proliferate to clear pathogens by secreting antibodies or cytokines. Some bioactive peptides were isolated from fermented milk in previous studies. One of the peptides, Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu (QEPVL), was synthesized and used in this experiment. Results show that QEPVL can significantly activate lymphocytes both in vitro and in vivo. QEPVL can also increase the lymphocyte proliferation rate and cyclic AMP levels. This positive regulation had a dose–effect relationship within certain concentration ranges. QEPVL can also inhibit LPS-induced inflammation by regulating nitric oxide release and the production of the cytokines IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α in vivo. Digesting QEPVL in artificial gastrointestinal juice yields the digestion product Gln-Glu-Pro-Val (QEPV), which exhibits bioactivities similar to those of QEPVL in vitro. Overall, QEPVL has significant immunomodulating effects on lymphocytes and contributes to inflammation treatment through the oral route as a functional food ingredient.	10.1039/c3fo60657k

3) Adams, C. et al."	"1) Milk derived tripeptides IPP (Ile-Pro-Pro) and VPP (Val-Pro-Pro) have shown promise as anti-hypertensive agents due to their inhibitory effects on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Due to the key inter-related roles of hypertension, chronic inflammation and insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, there is growing interest in investigating established anti-hypertensive agents for their effects on insulin sensitivity and inflammation. In this study, we examined the effects of IPP and VPP on 3T3-F442A murine pre-adipocytes, a widely used model for studying metabolic diseases. We found that both IPP and VPP induced beneficial adipogenic differentiation as manifested by intracellular lipid accumulation, upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and secretion of the protective lipid hormone adiponectin by these cells. The observed effects were similar to those induced by insulin, suggesting potential benefits in the presence of insulin resistance. IPP and VPP also inhibited cytokine induced pro-inflammatory changes such as reduction in adipokine levels and activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Taken together, our findings suggest that IPP and VPP exert insulin-mimetic adipogenic effects and prevent inflammatory changes in adipocytes, which may offer protection against metabolic disease,
2) Inflammation of adipose tissue triggers the metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis and CHD. In the present study, we investigated whether the milk casein-derived tripeptide valine-proline-proline (VPP) has an anti-inflammatory effect on the adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Male C57BL/6J mice (7 weeks of age) were fed ad libitum with either a HFD and plain tap water (HFD group) or a HFD and water containing 0·3 mg VPP/ml (HFD+VPP group) for 10 weeks. The results showed that the expression level of CD18 in the peripheral blood monocytes of the HFD+VPP group was significantly decreased compared with the level observed in those of the HFD group. Activated monocytes and pro-inflammatory macrophages were accumulated in the stromal vascular fractions of the adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice, which were significantly decreased in those supplemented with VPP. The formation of crown-like structures rich in pro-inflammatory macrophages was also significantly reduced in the adipose tissue of mice administered with VPP. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and that of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in adipose tissue tend to be lower in the HFD+VPP group than in the HFD group. These observations indicate that oral administration of VPP exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on the adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice, which may eventually lead to the primary prevention of chronic inflammation-related diseases.,
3) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry."	"1) 10.1371/journal.pone.0117492,

P02666	DMPIQAFLLYQEPVLGPVR	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	199-217	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory			Gram negative		Identification of a NFkappaB inhibitory peptide from tryptic β-casein hydrolysate	Malinowski, J. et al.	Several bioactive peptides are encrypted within the sequence of major milk proteins, requiring enzymatic proteolysis for release and activation. The present study aimed at the identification of potential anti-inflammatory activities in tryptic hydrolysates of bovine β-casein. Inflammatory processes involve in most cases an activation of Nuclear factor Kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), which is a pro-inflammatory transcription factor of several genes. Hence, a NFκB reporter cell line was established, and TNF-α mediated activation of NFκB was used as a measurement. Bovine β-casein (β-CN) was hydrolysed by trypsin and fractionated by ultrafiltration. Total proteolysate as well as the fraction containing peptides between 1 and 5 kDa showed an inhibitory effect in the cell-based assay, while the fraction containing molecules smaller than 1 kDa did not. This anti-inflammatory effect was ascribed to a group of large, hydrophobic peptides, which were identified using LC–MS. The main peptide was synthesised and showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect in HEKnfkb-RE-cells. Thus, for the first time, a casein-derived peptide having an anti-inflammatory effect in vitro has been identified.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.05.075

P02662	LAYFYPEL	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	157-164	Immunomodulatory						Enhancement of Antigen-Speciï¬c IFNg Production from CD81 T Cells by a Single Amino Acid-Substituted Peptide Derived from Bovine	Mamoru, T. et al.	Modulation of CD8+T-cell responses specific for an exogenous antigen by epitope variants would be advantageous to develop a novel means of antigen-specific immune regulation. We have analyzed CD8+T-cell responses to single amino acid-substituted variants of a peptide corresponding to residues 142–149 (p142-149; LAYFYPEL) of αs1-casein, a major milk allergen, which is a dominant determinant restricted by H-2Kb. An analog peptide L142I with a substitution of Ile for Leu at the nonanchor N-terminal residue induced more IFN-γ secretion than p142-149 from specific CD8+T cells. Furthermore, L142I could prime CD8+T cells more efficientlyin vivo,and these L142I-primed cells secreted more IFN-γ than p142-149-primed CD8+T cells upon stimulation with p142-149in vitro.These findings are mainly explained by the greater ability of L142I to form stable Kb–peptide complexes. These findings indicate that appropriate analog peptides may be useful as efficient inducers of CD8+T cells which recognize the parent peptide and secrete IFN-γ, a potent inhibitor of Th2-dependent events, including IgE production.	10.1006/clin.1998.4585
P02662	QMEAESISSSEEIVPNSVEQK	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	74-94	Immunomodulatory	Stimulated IgG, IgM, IgA production					Identification of a phosphopeptide in bovine α s1-casein digest as a factor influencing proliferation and immunoglobulin production in lymphocyte cultures	Hata, I. et al.	Digestion of bovine αs1-casein with bovine trypsin produced peptide(s) with an inhibitory effect on concanavalin A-induced proliferation of mouse spleen cells. One of these peptides was isolated from the αs1-casein digest following ultrafiltration, hydroxyapatite chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC, and amino acid composition and sequence analyses showed it to be sequence 59–79 from the phosphoserine-rich region of αs1-casein. The isolated peptide significantly inhibited the concanavalin A-induced proliferation of mouse spleen cells and rabbit Peyer's patch cells, whereas it enhanced the lipopolysaccharide- and phytohaemagglutinin-induced proliferation of both cells. The peptide displayed mitogenic activity in the cell cultures without the commercial mitogen, and significantly enhanced immunoglobulin production. Moreover, residues 1–25 from the phosphoserine-rich region of bovine β-casein had a similar effect on the proliferation of mouse spleen cells and rabbit Peyer's patch cells stimulated or not stimulated by the commercial mitogen.

Prolyl-rich peptides derived from hydrolysates of bovine caseins have been previously shown to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, suggesting that they may also be able to inhibit the enzymatic activities of prolyl-specific peptidases. This study shows that peptides derived from αS1-casein and β-casein inhibited the enzymatic activities of purified recombinant matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9. The inhibitory efficacy was sequence-dependent. These peptides also selectively inhibited the enzymatic activities of prolyl-amino-peptidases, prolyl-amino-dipeptidases, and prolyl-endopeptidases in extracts of HT-29 and SW480 human colon carcinoma cells, but not in intact cells. They were not cytotoxic or growth inhibitory for these cells. Thus, the prolyl-rich selected peptides were good and selective inhibitors of MMPs and post-proline-cleaving proteases, demonstrating their potential to control inadequate proteolytic activity in the human digestive tract, without inducing cytotoxic effects.	10.1021/jf102803a

A hexapeptide obtained from human casein by enzymatic digestion has been purified, sequenced and synthesized; its structure is: Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro-Tyr. In vitro this hexapeptide stimulates the phagocytosis of opsonized sheep red blood cells by murine peritoneal macrophages. Administered intravenously to adult mice, it enhances the resistance to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae.	10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb08609.x

P02668	YG	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	59-60	Immunomodulatory	Stimulated lymphocyte proliferation					Stimulation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes by bioactive peptides derived from bovine milk proteins	Kayser, H. et al.	The in vitro modulation of the proliferation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes of different synthetic peptides derived from milk proteins was investigated. Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.	10.1016/0014-5793(96)00207-4
P02666	YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-224	Immunomodulatory	Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages					A peptide derived from bovine β-casein modulates functional properties of bone marrow-derived macrophages from germfree and human flora-associated mice	Sandre, C. et al.	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of a peptide derived from bovine beta-casein (beta-CN), the beta-CN (193-209) peptide, on mouse macrophages that were obtained either from germfree (GF) or from human flora-associated (HF) mice. Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.	10.1093/jn/131.11.2936 
P02666	YPFPG	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-79	Immunomodulatory	Induce inflammatory immune response in gut					Consumption of β-casomorphins-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in mice gut through Th-2 pathway	Ul Haq, MR. et al.	β-Casomorphins are opioid like bioactive peptides released on digestion of β-casein of milk. In the present study in vivo impact of consumption of β-casomorphins (BCM-7/5) was evaluated on immune response of murine gut. The peptides were given to mice through oral intubation at a dose of 7.5 × 10−8 mol/day/animal for 15 days. Oral administration of both peptides individually increased (p <0.01) phenotypic expression of inflammation associated molecules (MPO, MCP-1, IL-4 and histamine), humoral immune response (IgE, IgG, IgG1/IgG2a), infiltration of leucocytes in intestinal villi and mRNA expression of toll like receptors (TLR-2 and TLR-4) in mice gut. However, no changes in sIgA, IgA+ and goblet cell numbers were recorded. These results clearly indicate that consumption of β-casein derived peptides BCM-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in gut, most likely through Th2 pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.03.018

A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2

P02663	NPWDQ	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	122-126	Immunomodulatory	Inhibited allergen intestinal permeation					Enzyme-modified cheese exerts inhibitory effects on allergen permeation in rats suffering from indomethacin-induced intestinal inflammation	Isobe, NA. et al.	We have found that an enzyme-modified cheese (EMC) inhibited the permeation of allergens such as ovalbumin (OVA), using Caco-2 cells as an in vitro intestinal epithelial model. In addition, NPWDQ (Asn-Pro-Trp-Asp-Gln, aa 107-111 of αs2-casein) was isolated from EMC and identified as one of the responsible peptides for this inhibitory activity (Tanabe et al., J. Agric. Food Chem., (2007)). In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism by which NPWDQ inhibited allergen permeation in vitro, and also to evaluate the effects of EMC on allergen permeation in vivo. Intestinal permeability for both fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated dextran and horseradish peroxidase was decreased in Caco-2 cells by the addition of NPWDQ, indicating that NPWDQ might inhibit both paracellular and transcellular transports. Next, intestinal inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injections of indomethacin to rats. When OVA was injected into the jejunal and ileac loops of indomethacin-administered rats with and without NPWDQ, it was found that the addition of NPWDQ effectively diminished OVA permeation from both loops. Although the plasma OVA concentration of indomethacin-administered rats after oral OVA challenge was markedly elevated over that of normal rats, supplemental administration of EMC to the rats effectively suppressed OVA permeation. These results suggest that EMC is useful for the prevention of food allergy by inhibiting allergen permeation probably by enforcing the intestinal barrier.	10.1271/bbb.80042
P02662	RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	16-38	Immunomodulatory	Stimulated phagocytosis in mice					Antibacterial and immunostimulating casein-derived substances from milk: Casecidin, isracidin peptides	Lavoh, E. et al.	Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified was casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of αs1-casein. This product consisted of the N-terminal segment (1–23) of αs1-casein B, named ‘isracidin’, and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest, in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source.	10.1016/0278-6915(95)00097-6
P14632	KCRQWQSKIRRTNPMFCIRR	Lactotransferrin	Sus scrofa	37-56	Immunomodulatory						Porcine lactoferrin derived peptide LFP-20 modulates immune homoeostasis	Zong, X. et al.	The performance of immune system is vital for defending the body from pathogens, and it plays a crucial role in health homoeostasis. In a previous study, we have shown that LFP-20, a twenty-amino acid antimicrobial peptide in the N terminus of porcine lactoferrin, modulated inflammatory response in colitis. Here, we further investigated the effects of LFP-20 on immune homoeostasis to elucidate the mechanism of its anti-inflammation action. A lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-triggered systemic inflammatory response mice model was established. On the basis of observed mucosal lesions and apoptosis in small intestine, we found increased macrophage and neutrophil infiltration in ileum after LPS stimulation. Expectedly, LFP-20 pre-treatment attenuated the LPS-mediated immune disorders in ileum. Moreover, the flow cytometry results indicated pre-treatment with LFP-20 sustained the balance of CD3+CD8+ T cells, B cells and natural killer cells in LPS-triggered immune disturbance. Simultaneously, we demonstrated LFP-20 modulated the secretion of both activated Th1-related IL-12p70, interferon-γ, TNF-α and Th2-related IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6. Furthermore, we found LFP-20 facilitated a balanced Th1 and Th2 response, which triggered cellular defence mechanisms and induced B cells to produce opsonising antibodies belonging to certain IgG subclasses to defend against LPS stimulation. Collectively, our study indicated pre-treatment with LFP-20 could defend against LPS-triggered systemic inflammatory response in mice via modulating immune homoeostasis.	10.1017/S0007114519000485
P02754	IPAV	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	94-97	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					A novel whey tetrapeptide IPAV reduces interleukin-8 production induced by TNF-α in human intestinal Caco-2 cells	Oyama, M. et al.	In the present study, an anti-inflammatory effect of enzymatic whey protein hydrolysate was examined in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Stimulation of Caco-2 cells with tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α induced interleukin (IL)-8 expression through the activation of nuclear factor kappa B p65, spleen tyrosine kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases pathways. Pre-treatment of cells with whey protein hydrolysate reduced TNF-α-induced IL-8 expression. Mass spectrometry analysis has identified the active tetrapeptide IPAV, which corresponded to amino acids 94–97 of β-lactoglobulin. Pre-treatment of cells with IPAV reduced TNF-α-induced IL-8 expression and the increase in phosphorylation levels of key cellular signalling proteins. Pharmacological inhibition of peptide transporter 1 (PepT1), but not of calcium-sensing receptor, attenuated IPAV-mediated suppression of IL-8 expression. In summary, a novel anti-inflammatory tetrapeptide IPAV, derived from whey protein hydrolysate, reduced IL-8 expression induced by TNF-α. Our results suggest that IPAV, transported by PepT1, can suppress inflammatory signalling in intestinal cells.	10.1016/j.jff.2017.06.001

2) Inflammation and oxidative stress are closely linked patho-physiological processes which occur concurrently in many diseased conditions. Recently, interdependence between these two processes explains the antioxidant paradox associated with failure to select appropriate agents required for prevention of diseases known to be induced by oxidative stress. Present study established the overlapping anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative potential along with bio-accessibility of milk casein derived tripeptide (LLY). Tripeptide exhibited anti-inflammatory response under ex vivo conditions by suppressing (P<.01) mice splenocytes proliferation and modulating their cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β) with improved phagocytosis of peritoneal macrophages. Conversely, tripeptide displayed extraordinary radical scavenging ability and cellular anti-oxidative potential using chemical assays and H2O2 induced oxidative stress model on Caco-2 cells. Under cellular assessment, on one hand tripeptide inhibited (P<.01) intracellular ROS generation and reduced MDA and protein carbonyls but on the other also increased (P<.01) the activity of anti-oxidative enzyme, catalase without much effect on SOD and GPx. This anti-oxidative potential was further established by studying relative expression of genes (Nrf-2 and Keap1) and Nrf-2 nuclear translocation associated with anti-oxidative signaling in Caco-2 cells. Bio-accessibility of tripeptide and its intact transport across Caco-2 cell monolayer was also found to be 1.72±0.22% through PepT1 mediated transport mechanism. Besides, tripeptide displayed strong anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potential under in vivo conditions in mice against ethanol induced oxidative stress by elevating (P<.01) liver GSH content and by decreasing (P<.01) the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes, MDA along with reduced expression of CYP2E1, PPAR-α, TNF-α and COX-2 genes than ethanol control."

O62823	YFYPQL	Alpha-S1-casein	Bubalus bubalis	159-164	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potential with trans-epithelial transport of a buffalo casein-derived hexapeptide (YFYPQL)	Kandukuri, S. et al.	Inflammation and oxidative stress are two patho-physiological processes that go together. Anti-oxidants can be used as anti-inflammatory mediators to avoid the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. The overlapping antioxidative and anti-inflammatory potentials of a buffalo casein-derived hexapeptide (YFYPQL) were studied with in vitro and ex vivo assays. An in vitro Caco-2 cell model suggested that pre-treatment with the hexapeptide showed protection against H2O2 induced oxidative cell death and inhibited (p ≤ 0.01) ROS generation. Peptide treatment also reduced (p ≤ 0.01) the levels of cellular oxidative products of lipids and proteins (MDA and protein carbonyls) and elevated (p ≤ 0.05) the activities of the anti-oxidative enzymes (CAT, SOD and GPX) by stimulating the nuclear response factor-2 (Nrf-2) stress signalling pathway. Moreover, peptide treatment reduced (p ≤ 0.01) the Nrf-2 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells even in the presence of H2O2. In addition to the antioxidative properties, this peptide also had a role in anti-inflammation with ex vivo conditions by suppressing (p ≤ 0.01) mice splenocytes proliferation and enhancing the phagocytosis of murine peritoneal macrophages. Peptide treatment was also found to reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ) and elevated the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 in splenocytes culture supernatants. Besides, the hexapeptide showed 0.91 ± 0.04% intact transport across the Caco-2 cell monolayer with an apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of 4.75 × 10−5 cm min−1 using a transcytosis mediated mechanism. Thus, overlapping antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities as well as transport across the epithelial membrane of the casein hexapeptide was established.	10.1016/j.fbio.2019.02.003

Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976

"1) Maternal colostrum and milk, the earliest food of the newborn, should not only be considered as supplying nutrients, but also as agents providing protection against aggressions from the new environment. Indeed by enzymatic digestion of the main milk proteins, the caseins, biologically active peptides are released; they may be implicated in the stimulation of the newborn's immune system. From this point of view a ‘strategic active zone’ has been characterized in β-casein. A possible role of casein as a ‘prohormone’ for the newborn is suggested.,
2) Bioactive peptides are an emerging area of biomedical research in the study of numerous human diseases, including acute alcoholic liver injury (AALI). To study the role and mechanism of the milk‑derived hexapeptide Pro‑Gly‑Pro‑Ile‑Pro‑Asn (PGPIPN) in preventing and reducing AALI, the present study established a mouse model of AALI. PGPIPN was used as a therapeutic drug, and glutathione (GSH) was used as a positive control. The body and liver weights of mice were measured, and the liver indexes were calculated to observe mice health. The pathological morphology of liver tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin were examined to analyze hepatic injury, and hepatocyte apoptosis was measured with a TUNEL assay. The concentrations or activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6, triglyceride, total cholesterol, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and GSH peroxidase (GSH‑PX) were detected in serum and/or liver homogenates. The 78 kDa glucose‑regulated protein (GRP78), protein kinase R‑like (PKR) endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), phosphorylated (p)‑PERK, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF‑2α), p-eIF-2α, inositol‑requiring enzyme 1α (IRE‑1α), spliced X‑box binding protein 1 (XBP‑1s), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), caspase‑3 and cleaved caspase‑3 proteins associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes were assessed by western blotting, and RNA levels of XBP‑1s, CHOP and caspase‑3 genes were assessed by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The results suggested that PGPIPN attenuated alcoholic hepatocyte damage in animal models and reduced hepatocyte oxidative stress in a dose‑dependent manner. Moreover, PGPIPN reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress by regulating the expression levels of p‑PERK, p‑eIF‑2α, XBP‑1s, CHOP, caspase‑3 and cleaved caspase‑3. Collectively, the present results indicated that PGPIPN, as a potential therapeutic drug for AALI, exerted a protective effect on the liver and could reduce liver damage.,

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976

"1) The immunomodulatory effect of GMP and its derivates on the cell proliferative response of human macrophagelike cell, U937, and its effect on phagocytic activities via incorporation of fluorescence beads were studied. GMP was found to be a potent immunoenhancer at low concentrations, significantly enhancing the proliferation and phagocytic activities of U937. The modulatory function could be radically altered by enzymatic treatments. Pepsin digestion significantly enhanced the degree of cell proliferation and phagocytic activities, whereas trypsin had no significant effect. The immunoenhancing effects decreased significantly after sialidase treatment; however, more than 70% of activity was retained after treatment. GMP with different carbohydrate chains was shown to possess different modulatory capabilities. Sialic acid-rich GMP fractions showed an enhanced response. These findings indicate that both the carbohydrate chains compositions, including the terminal sialic acids and the polypeptide portions of GMP, are essential for the stimulatory effects of GMP on cell proliferation and phagocytic activities of U937.,
2) Background and purpose: Bovine glycomacropeptide (BGMP) is a natural milk peptide that is produced naturally in the gastrointestinal tract during digestion. Glycomacropepide has intestinal anti-inflammatory activity, but the mechanism of action is unknown. Here we have characterized the effects of BGMP on monocytes.

Experimental approach: We have used human THP-1 cells as an in vitro monocyte model. The effect of BGMP on the secretion of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-8 was assessed, as well as the involvement of the NF-κB and MAP kinase signalling pathways. The stimulatory effect of BGMP was also tested in human peripheral blood monocytes.

Key results: BGMP up-regulated the secretion of TNF, IL-1β and IL-8 in a concentration-dependent fashion. The biological activity was exerted by the intact peptide, because cytokine secretion was not affected by protease inhibitors. The secretion of IL-8 and specially TNF and IL-1β was blocked by PD98059, SP600125, SB203580 and Bay11-7082, suggesting the involvement of the MAP kinases p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase and ERK and particularly the NF-κB pathway, although IL-8 secretion was independent of p38. BGMP was shown to elicit the phosphorylation of IκB-α and the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunits p50 and p65. The effect of BGMP on cytokine secretion was validated in human primary blood monocytes.

Conclusions and implications: BGMP stimulates human monocytes, operating via MAP kinase and NF-κB pathways. BGMP may exert an indirect intestinal anti-inflammatory effect by potentiating host defences against invading microorganisms.,
3) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced enteropathy is considered a serious and increasing clinical problem without available treatment. Glycomacropeptide (GMP) is a 64-amino acid peptide derived from milk κ-casein with numerous biological activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of GMP on NSAID enteropathy in rats. Enteropathy was induced by seven days oral indomethacin administration. Rats were orally GMP treated from seven days previous and during the establishment of the enteropathy model. Changes in metabolism, hematological and biochemical blood alterations, intestinal inflammation and oxidative damage were analyzed. Integrity barrier markers, macroscopic intestinal damage and survival rate were also evaluated. GMP treatment prevented anorexia and weight loss in animals. Furthermore, prophylaxis with GMP ameliorated the decline in hemoglobin, hematocrit, albumin and total protein levels. The treatment had no therapeutic efficacy on the decrease of occludin and mucin (MUC)-2 expression in intestinal tissue. However, GMP markedly decreased neutrophil infiltration, and CXCL1, interleukin-1β and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression. Nitric oxide production and lipid hydroperoxide level in the small intestine were also diminished. These beneficial effects were mirrored by preventing ulcer development and increasing animal survival. These results suggest that GMP may protect against NSAID enteropathy through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.,
4) Background. Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), a major worldwide concern for the public health system, refers to a cluster of key metabolic components, and represents a risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. As oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation are the major triggers of insulin sensitivity (IS), a cardinal MetS feature, the principal aim of the present work is to determine whether glycomacropeptide (GMP), a milk-derived bioactive peptide, exerts beneficial effects on their expression. Methods. Fully differentiated intestinal Caco-2/15 cells are used to evaluate the preventive action of 2 mg/mL GMP against OxS and inflammation induced by the mixture iron-ascorbate (Fe/Asc) (200 μM:2 mM). The potency of GMP of decreasing the production of lipoproteins, including chylomicrons (CM), very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is also assessed. Results. The administration of GMP significantly reduces malondialdehyde, a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, and raises superoxide dismutase 2 and glutathione peroxidase via the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2, a transcription factor, which orchestrates cellular antioxidant defenses. Similarly, GMP markedly lowers the inflammatory agents tumor necrosis factor-α and cyclooxygenase-2 via abrogation of the nuclear transcription factor-kB. Moreover, GMP-treated cells show a down-regulation of Fe/Asc-induced mitogen activated protein kinase pathway, suggesting greater IS. Finally, GMP decreases the production of CM, VLDL, and LDL. Conclusions. Our results highlight the effectiveness of GMP in attenuating OxS, inflammation and lipoprotein biogenesis, as well as improving IS, the key components of MetS. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanisms mediating the preventive action of GMP."	"1) 10.1021/jf0355102,

2) Cai, J. et al."	"1) Antibiotic resistance has been considered to be a global threat which underscores the need to develop novel anti-infective therapeutics. Modulation of innate immunity by synthetic peptides is an attractive strategy to overcome this circumstance. We recently reported that BCCY-1, a human β-casein-derived peptide displays regulatory activities on monocytes, thereby enhancing their actions in innate immune responses. However, the function of peptide BCCY-1 in host defense against infection remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the in vivo characteristics and effects of peptide BCCY-1 in mouse models of bacterial infection. Following intraperitoneal injection, the peptide BCCY-1 exhibited high level of cellular uptake by monocytes without obvious toxicities. Results revealed that peptide BCCY-1, but not the scrambled version, stimulated the chemokine production and monocyte recruitment in vivo. Treatment with BCCY-1 enhanced the pathogen clearance and protected mice against lethal infections. Because the anti-infective effects of BCCY-1 was abolished by in vivo depletion of monocytes/macrophages rather than lymphocytes and granulocytes, we conclude that monocytes/macrophages are key effector cells in BCCY-1-mediated anti-infective protection. Additionally, BCCY-1 lacks direct antimicrobial activity. To our knowledge, a human β-casein-derived peptide that counters infection by selective regulation of innate immunity has not been reported previously. These results suggest peptide BCCY-1 as a promising alternative approach and a valuable complement to current anti-infective strategy.,
2) In this study, we report a novel peptide corresponding to the sequence of human β-casein (named BCCY-1), which was identified in our previous peptidome analysis of human milk and has great immunomodulatory activity. The results revealed that peptide BCCY-1, but not the scrambled version, enhanced monocyte migration without obvious toxicities. This selective effect was mediated via increased production of chemokines by peptide stimulated monocytes. Moreover, BCCY-1 exerted its modulatory effects by activating nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. The abundances of peptide BCCY-1 and the peptides partially encompassing its fragment were found to be lower in preterm milk than in term milk. Our study may lead to new insights into the immunoregulatory effects of casein-derived peptides and facilitate the discovery of novel peptide-based food and pharmaceutical products."

Identification  of  a  phosphopeptide  in  bovine  α  s1-casein  digest  as  a  factor  influencing  proliferation  and  immunoglobulin  production  in  lymphocyte  cultures.  	Hata,  I. et al.	Digestion of bovine αs1-casein with bovine trypsin produced peptide(s) with an inhibitory effect on concanavalin A-induced proliferation of mouse spleen cells. One of these peptides was isolated from the αs1-casein digest following ultrafiltration, hydroxyapatite chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC, and amino acid composition and sequence analyses showed it to be sequence 59–79 from the phosphoserine-rich region of αs1-casein. The isolated peptide significantly inhibited the concanavalin A-induced proliferation of mouse spleen cells and rabbit Peyer's patch cells, whereas it enhanced the lipopolysaccharide- and phytohaemagglutinin-induced proliferation of both cells. The peptide displayed mitogenic activity in the cell cultures without the commercial mitogen, and significantly enhanced immunoglobulin production. Moreover, residues 1–25 from the phosphoserine-rich region of bovine β-casein had a similar effect on the proliferation of mouse spleen cells and rabbit Peyer's patch cells stimulated or not stimulated by the commercial mitogen. These results indicate that caseinophosphopeptides may act as a humoral immunostimulator in cell cultures.	10.1017/s0022029998003136

Tonolo, F. et al.	Redox status and inflammation are related to the pathogenesis of the majority of diseases. Therefore, understanding the role of specific food-derived molecules in the regulation of their specific pathways is a relevant issue. Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-α, the levels of NF-κB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-α alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-α) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.	10.3390/ijms23084382
