The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption.",Increase cellular growth,"Natriuresis can increase the renal blood flow which can potentially promote cellular growth.

In circulation, the proteolytic inactivation of ANP has been demonstrated to involve both membrane metalloendopeptidase and an aprotonin-sensitive activity, probably corresponding to kallikrein [Vanneste, Y., Pauwels, S., Lambotte, L., Michel, A., Dimaline, R. & Deschodt-Lanckman, M.

In order to identify the cleavage sites recognized by kallikrein within the sequence of the hormone, tissue kallikrein was purified to homogeneity from human urine and the degradation of human ANP by the enzyme preparation was studied. Our results demonstrate that both intact and Cys7-Phe8-cleaved ANP, the initial metabolite produced in circulation by the metallo-endopeptidase, are substrates in vitro for purified tissue kallikrein. However, the Cys-Phe-cleaved peptide was degraded approximately fourfold faster than the intact hormone by the purified enzyme. The first degradation step of ANP by tissue kallikrein involves two cleavages occurring at the bonds Arg3-Arg4 and Gly16-Ala17, generating an inactive, open-ring metabolite. Incubation of ANP for a longer period with the enzyme led to the generation of several additional degradation fragments. Ten peaks were separated by HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis. The results allowed the identification of a total of eight peptide bonds susceptible to hydrolysis by tissue kallikrein in the sequence of ANP: Arg3-Arg4, Ser5-Ser6, Cys7-Phe8, Arg11-Met12, Gly16-Ala17, Gly20-Leu21, Ser25-Phe26 and Arg27-Tyr28.

In order to identify the cleavage sites recognized by kallikrein within the sequence of the hormone, tissue kallikrein was purified to homogeneity from human urine and the degradation of human ANP by the enzyme preparation was studied. Our results demonstrate that both intact and Cys7-Phe8-cleaved ANP, the initial metabolite produced in circulation by the metallo-endopeptidase, are substrates in vitro for purified tissue kallikrein. However, the Cys-Phe-cleaved peptide was degraded approximately fourfold faster than the intact hormone by the purified enzyme. The first degradation step of ANP by tissue kallikrein involves two cleavages occurring at the bonds Arg3-Arg4 and Gly16-Ala17, generating an inactive, open-ring metabolite. Incubation of ANP for a longer period with the enzyme led to the generation of several additional degradation fragments. Ten peaks were separated by HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis. The results allowed the identification of a total of eight peptide bonds susceptible to hydrolysis by tissue kallikrein in the sequence of ANP: Arg3-Arg4, Ser5-Ser6, Cys7-Phe8, Arg11-Met12, Gly16-Ala17, Gly20-Leu21, Ser25-Phe26 and Arg27-Tyr28. These results indicate that the aprotinin-sensitive activity involved in the metabolism of ANP in circulation could correspond to tissue kallikrein. However, clear identification of ANP as a novel physiological substrate of the enzyme will need further investigation.",Enhance insulin signaling,"The peptide's ability to regulate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis, including the activation of AMPK, indicates a potential role in enhancing insulin signaling.","In adipose tissue, acts in various cGMP- and PKG-dependent pathways to regulate lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis.

This vasodilation was associated with a 4 to 5 fold increase in cyclic GMP in the aorta secondary to activation of particulate guanylate cyclase [E.C. 4.6.12].

Conversely, reduced IDE expression enhances the stimulation of NPR-A and NPR-B by ANP and CNP, respectively. Instead of proteolytic inactivation, IDE cleavage can lead to hyperactivation of BNP toward NPR-A. Conversely, decreasing IDE expression reduces BNP-mediated signaling. Additionally, the cleavages of ANP and BNP by IDE render them active with NPR-B and a reduction of IDE expression diminishes the ability of ANP and BNP to stimulate NPR-B. Our kinetic and crystallographic analyses offer the molecular basis for the selective degradation of NPs and their variants by IDE. Furthermore, our studies reveal how IDE utilizes its catalytic chamber and exosite to engulf and bind up to two NPs leading to biased stochastic, non-sequential cleavages and the ability of IDE to switch its substrate selectivity.

Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively.

The aim of this study was to determine plasma levels of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide in normal subjects and in patients with essential hypertension, cardiac transplant and chronic renal failure, using radioimmunoassays directed towards the mid-portion pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) and pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (1-30) of the N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide (99-126). The circulating form(s) of the immunoreactive N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in plasma extracts has been investigated using all three radioimmunoassays by means of gel filtration chromatography to further clarify the major immunoreactive molecular circulating form(s) of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in man. 2. The plasma level (mean +/- SEM) of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) in the normal subjects was 547.2 +/- 32.7 pg/ml (n = 36) and was significantly elevated in patients with essential hypertension (730.2 +/- 72.3 pg/ml, P < 0.025, n = 39), in cardiac transplant recipients (3214.0 +/- 432.2 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 9) and in patients with chronic renal failure (3571.8 +/- 474.1 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 11).

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values. Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion.

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties.

Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion.

ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion.

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship.

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm.",Increase exocrine pancreatic secretion,"Since prostaglandins are known to stimulate the secretion of bicarbonate and digestive enzymes in the exocrine pancreas, enhancing their synthesis could potentially lead to increased exocrine pancreatic secretion.","The peptide is said to enhance prostaglandin E2 synthesis (PubMed:7720651), which can trigger an increase in exocrine pancreatic secretion"

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties.

Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion.

Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm.",Increase cellular growth,"Protein reabsorption is a key factor in cellular growth and survival.

Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion.

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values. Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion. Vessel dilator did not decrease plasma aldosterone levels. Kaliuretic peptide, ANF and long acting natriuretic peptide also decreased (P < 0.01) urinary aldosterone concentrations. None of these peptides changed the plasma potassium concentration. We conclude that two new peptide hormones (long acting natriuretic peptide and kaliuretic peptide) inhibit aldosterone secretion.

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion.

Three active peptides were purified by two steps of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Their structures were Tyr-Leu-Gly-Ser-Gly-Tyr-OCH3, Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-OCH2, and Lys-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Tyr-OCH3, which respectively correspond to the methyl esters of residues 318-323, 536-540, and 673-679 of human lactoferrin. The IC50 values of these peptides were 15, 10 and 23 microM, respectively, in a radioreceptor assay in the presence of 1 nM [3H]naloxone. In the myenteric plexus preparation of the longitudinal muscle of guinea pig ileum, the individual peptides had no opioid agonist activities, but they antagonized [Met5]enkephalin and morphiceptin when they were at a concentration of 10(-6)-10(-5) M, suggesting that these were the opioid antagonist peptides. These three opioid antagonist peptides were named lactoferroxin A, B and C, after casoxin, the opioid antagonist peptide derived from bovine kappa-casein. Concerning the antagonist activities of lactoferroxins for opioid receptor sub-types, lactoferroxin A showed preference for mu-receptors, while lactoferroxin B and C had somewhat higher degrees of preference for kappa-receptors than for mu-receptors. A study of the structure-activity relationship of the three lactoferroxins and their synthetic analogues showed that these opioid antagonist peptides derived from food protein could be expressed by the general formula XA-Tyr-XB-Tyr-OCH3. An amino acid in position XA may affect the specificity of the antagonist peptide for opioid receptor sub-types.",Opioid,"The bioactivity functions were derived from the reported affinity for opioid receptors, specifically demonstrating antagonist activity in the described experiment.

These molecules have broad-spectrum killing activity against microbes and can have effects on specific mammalian cell types, potentially stimulating additional immune defense through direct chemotactic activity or induction of cytokine release. In humans, the cathelicidin hCAP18/LL-37 is processed to LL-37 in neutrophils, but on skin it can be further proteolytically processed to shorter forms. The influence of these cathelicidin peptides on keratinocyte function is not known. In the current study, DNA microarray analysis and confirmatory protein analysis showed that LL-37 affects the expression of several chemokines and cytokines by keratinocytes. Analysis of a synthetic peptide library derived from LL-37 showed that antimicrobial activity against bacterial, fungal, and viral skin pathogens resides within specific domains of the parent peptide, but antimicrobial activity does not directly correlate with the ability to stimulate IL-8 production in keratinocytes. IL-8 release was induced by d- and l-amino acid forms of cathelicidin and correlated with membrane permeability, suggesting that highly structure-specific binding to a cell surface receptor is not likely. However, this effect was inhibited by either pertussis toxin or AG1478, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting that cathelicidin may indirectly stimulate multiple signaling pathways associated with cell surface receptors. Taken together, these observations suggest that proteolytic processing may alter the balance between cathelicidin antimicrobial and host immunostimulatory functions.",Anticancer,"Although not directly stated, the ability to destroy bacterial cells by forming fiber-like assemblies on their membranes may suggest potential anticancer properties due to similarities in the mechanisms used by antimicrobial and anticancer peptides.",May form supramolecular fiber-like assemblies on bacterial membranes.

The N-terminal fragment, LL-37(1-12), was not active, while the C-terminal fragment, LL-37(13-37), killed Escherichia coli, as well as drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. A 13-residue core antibacterial and anticancer peptide, corresponding to residues 17-29 of LL-37, was identified based on total correlated spectroscopy by trimming nonessential regions (TOCSY-trim). Because LL-37 acts on bacterial membranes, three-dimensional structures of its fragments were determined in micelles by NMR, including structural refinement by natural abundance 15N and 13C chemical shifts. Aromatic-aromatic interactions in the N-terminal fragment were proposed to be essential for LL-37 aggregation. The LL-37 core peptide adopts a similar structure in the micelles of SDS or dioctanoyl phosphatidylglycerol. This structure is retained in the C-terminal fragment LL-37(13-37) and very likely in intact LL-37 based on peptide-aided signal assignments. The higher antibacterial activity of the LL-37 core peptide than aurein 1.2 was attributed to additional cationic residues. To achieve selective membrane targeting, D-amino acids were incorporated into LL-37(17-32). While the D-peptide showed similar antibacterial activity to the L-diastereomer, it lost toxicity to human cells. Structural analysis revealed hydrophobic defects in the new amphipathic structure of the D-peptide, leading to a much shorter retention time on a reversed-phase HPLC column. It is proposed that hydrophobic defects as a result of incoherent hydrophobic packing provide a structural basis for the improvement in cell selectivity of the LL-37 fragment.",Antimicrobial,"The peptide has been described to have antimicrobial activity in the context of innate immunity, binding with bacterial lipopolysaccharides and inhibiting bacterial growth.","The peptide LL-29 is described as an antimicrobial protein that is an integral component of the innate immune system.

Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined.

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.",Cell Penetrating,"The ability to penetrate cell membranes serves as a core function of the peptide in its antimicrobial role, and thus, it can also be classified as having a Cell Penetrating function.

The N-terminal fragment, LL-37(1-12), was not active, while the C-terminal fragment, LL-37(13-37), killed Escherichia coli, as well as drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. A 13-residue core antibacterial and anticancer peptide, corresponding to residues 17-29 of LL-37, was identified based on total correlated spectroscopy by trimming nonessential regions (TOCSY-trim). Because LL-37 acts on bacterial membranes, three-dimensional structures of its fragments were determined in micelles by NMR, including structural refinement by natural abundance 15N and 13C chemical shifts. Aromatic-aromatic interactions in the N-terminal fragment were proposed to be essential for LL-37 aggregation.

Many of the known human antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional, with stimulatory activities such as chemotaxis while simultaneously acting as natural antibiotics. In humans, eccrine appendages express DCD and CAMP, genes encoding proteins processed into the antimicrobial peptides dermcidin and LL-37. In this study we show that after secretion onto the skin surface, the CAMP gene product is processed by a serine protease-dependent mechanism into multiple novel antimicrobial peptides distinct from the cathelicidin LL-37. These peptides show enhanced antimicrobial action, acquiring the ability to kill skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Furthermore, although LL-37 may influence the host inflammatory response by stimulating IL-8 release from keratinocytes, this activity is lost in subsequently processed peptides. Thus, a single gene product encoding an important defense molecule alters structure and function in the topical environment to shift the balance of activity toward direct inhibition of microbial colonization.",Antimicrobial,"The text clearly describes several instances where the peptide acts as an antimicrobial, inhibiting the growth of various bacteria and acting cooperatively with other peptides to kill bacteria.

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure.

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway.",Antimicrobial,The peptide has been described as an antimicrobial protein that forms part of the innate immune system.

The N-terminal fragment, LL-37(1-12), was not active, while the C-terminal fragment, LL-37(13-37), killed Escherichia coli, as well as drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cancer cells. A 13-residue core antibacterial and anticancer peptide, corresponding to residues 17-29 of LL-37, was identified based on total correlated spectroscopy by trimming nonessential regions (TOCSY-trim). Because LL-37 acts on bacterial membranes, three-dimensional structures of its fragments were determined in micelles by NMR, including structural refinement by natural abundance 15N and 13C chemical shifts. Aromatic-aromatic interactions in the N-terminal fragment were proposed to be essential for LL-37 aggregation. The LL-37 core peptide adopts a similar structure in the micelles of SDS or dioctanoyl phosphatidylglycerol. This structure is retained in the C-terminal fragment LL-37(13-37) and very likely in intact LL-37 based on peptide-aided signal assignments. The higher antibacterial activity of the LL-37 core peptide than aurein 1.2 was attributed to additional cationic residues. To achieve selective membrane targeting, D-amino acids were incorporated into LL-37(17-32). While the D-peptide showed similar antibacterial activity to the L-diastereomer, it lost toxicity to human cells.

Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p.

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists.
