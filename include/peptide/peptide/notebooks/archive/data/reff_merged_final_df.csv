The peptide, termed kaliocin-1, and lactoferrin showed a bactericidal effect in assays performed in low-ionic-strength conditions. This is the first time that it is shown that the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin depends on the extracellular cation concentration. The antimicrobial effect of kaliocin-1 was lower than that of human lactoferrin, but their activities were inhibited by Na(+) or K(+) in a cation concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the peptide was able to mimic native lactoferrin, inducing K(+)-efflux and a selective dissipation of the transmembrane electrical potential of Escherichia coli cells without causing extensive damage to the outer and inner bacterial membranes. In contrast, the peptide, but not lactoferrin, was able to permeabilize different ions through liposomal membranes. The hypothetical interaction of kaliocin-1 with a bacterial membrane compound is discussed based in the different ion flux induced on cellular and artificial membranes as well as data from circular dichroism assays. Kaliocin-1 was not cytotoxic and could be a suitable model for the design of analogs able to mimic the antibacterial effect of human lactoferrin."

Shows preference for mu-receptor (PubMed:1369293).,,Isolation and characterization of opioid antagonist peptides derived from human lactoferrin.,"Tani, F. et al.",10.1271/bbb1961.54.1803,1369293,"Peptides with affinity for opioid receptors were found in an artificially methyl-esterified peptic digest of human lactoferrin. Three active peptides were purified by two steps of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Their structures were Tyr-Leu-Gly-Ser-Gly-Tyr-OCH3, Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-OCH2, and Lys-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Pro-Gln-Tyr-OCH3, which respectively correspond to the methyl esters of residues 318-323, 536-540, and 673-679 of human lactoferrin. The IC50 values of these peptides were 15, 10 and 23 microM, respectively, in a radioreceptor assay in the presence of 1 nM [3H]naloxone. In the myenteric plexus preparation of the longitudinal muscle of guinea pig ileum, the individual peptides had no opioid agonist activities, but they antagonized [Met5]enkephalin and morphiceptin when they were at a concentration of 10(-6)-10(-5) M, suggesting that these were the opioid antagonist peptides. These three opioid antagonist peptides were named lactoferroxin A, B and C, after casoxin, the opioid antagonist peptide derived from bovine kappa-casein. Concerning the antagonist activities of lactoferroxins for opioid receptor sub-types, lactoferroxin A showed preference for mu-receptors, while lactoferroxin B and C had somewhat higher degrees of preference for kappa-receptors than for mu-receptors. A study of the structure-activity relationship of the three lactoferroxins and their synthetic analogues showed that these opioid antagonist peptides derived from food protein could be expressed by the general formula XA-Tyr-XB-Tyr-OCH3. An amino acid in position XA may affect the specificity of the antagonist peptide for opioid receptor sub-types."

Casein is also considered as a source of amino acids and generating peptides with biological activities such as opiate, immunostimulating, antibacterial, peptidase inhibitors, among others. In this work, Sephadex G-10 chromatography followed by high-performance liquid chromatography isolation purified NZCase TT, an industrial culture media for tetanus toxin production. In the first step, four pools were isolated and tested in different assays: isolated smooth muscle assay (guinea pig ileum, rat uterus), phagocytosis in vitro of opsonized sheep red blood cells, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release from mouse peritoneal macrophages. Pool III was the main active pool being able to potentiate bradykinin action in guinea pig ileum, stimulating phagocitic activity by resident macrophages and increasing H2O2 release from macrophages previously activated with bacille Calmette Guérin. Using mass spectra the primary structure of the main peptide from pool III was obtained--INKKI, which corresponds to beta-casein fragment 26-30. The immunostimulating action is probably related to a direct action in macrophage cells."

This paper describes the isolation and sequencing of a novel bradykinin-potentiating peptide, generated by tryptic hydrolysis of the gamma-casein chain. No homology was found to other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides. The octapeptide Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe-Thr-Glu, corresponding to the gamma-casein(114-121) sequence, was isolated from the tryptic hydrolysis of gamma-casein and also synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Both natural and synthetic peptides had the same retention time in HPLC and displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea-pig ileum for bradykinin and Lys-bradykinin but were not able to potentiate the effects of Met-Lys-bradykinin, Ile-Ser-bradykinin, angiotensin II, acetylcholine, or histamine. Intravenous injections of bradykinin and of bradykinin-potentiating octapeptide produced a persistent hypotension in conscious rats, a pattern that was not obtained when the octapeptide was replaced by captopril. This bradykinin-potentiating octapeptide is a strong competitive inhibitor of endo-oligopeptidase A (EC 3.4.24.15, formerly EC 3.4.22.19), but it has low inhibitory potency towards angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1). Thus, our results suggest that other peptidases in addition to angiotensin-converting enzyme, such as endo-oligopeptidase A, may contribute to the reduction of the effective concentration of bradykinin in the circulation."

This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108-113 and 114-121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response."

The peptide bonds Ala-23-Lys-24, Leu-32-Ser-33, Ala-71-Gln-72, Leu-79-Ser-80, Met-95-Ala-96, and Met-106-Ala-107 were cleaved by both proteinase types, although the relative rates of hydrolysis at some of these sites were quite different for the two proteinases. Small histidine-rich peptides were formed as early products of the action of the cell envelope-associated proteinases on kappa-casein, implicating this casein as a possible significant source of histidine, which is essential for starter growth. The major difference between the two proteinase types in their action on kappa-casein was in their ability to cleave bonds near the C-terminal end of the molecule. The bond Asn-160-Thr-161 and, to a lesser extent, the bond Glu-151-Val-152 were very rapidly cleaved by the PIII-type proteinase, whereas hydrolysis of these bonds by the PI-type proteinase was barely detectable (even after 24 h of digestion). Differential hydrolysis of kappa-casein at these sites by the two different proteinase types resulted in the formation of distinctive, high-M(r) products detectable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

A single active peptide representing this domain was isolated following gastric pepsin cleavage of human lactoferrin, and bovine lactoferrin, and sequenced by automated Edman degradation. The antimicrobial sequence was found to consist mainly of a loop of 18 amino acid residues formed by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues 20 and 37 of human lactoferrin, or 19 and 36 of bovine lactoferrin. Synthetic analogs of this region similarly exhibited potent antibacterial properties. The active peptide of bovine lactoferrin was more potent than that of human lactoferrin having effectiveness against various Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria at concentrations between 0.3 microM and 3.0 microM, depending on the target strain. The effect of the isolated domain was lethal causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability. Our studies suggest this domain is the structural region responsible for the bacterial properties of lactoferrin."
