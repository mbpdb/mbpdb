Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone that induces insulin secretion. Here we show that administration of IL-6 or elevated IL-6 concentrations in response to exercise stimulate GLP-1 secretion from intestinal L cells and pancreatic alpha cells, improving insulin secretion and glycemia. IL-6 increased GLP-1 production from alpha cells through increased proglucagon (which is encoded by GCG) and prohormone convertase 1/3 expression. In models of type 2 diabetes, the beneficial effects of IL-6 were maintained, and IL-6 neutralization resulted in further elevation of glycemia and reduced pancreatic GLP-1. Hence, IL-6 mediates crosstalk between insulin-sensitive tissues, intestinal L cells and pancreatic islets to adapt to changes in insulin demand. This previously unidentified endocrine loop implicates IL-6 in the regulation of insulin secretion and suggests that drugs modulating this loop may be useful in type 2 diabetes."

Furthermore, mass spectrometry of the methyl-esterified peptide showed an increase in mass compatible with the presence of alpha-carboxyl amidation. Thus, the gut-derived insulinotrophic hormone GLP-1 is shown to be PG 78-107 amide."

The glucagon-like peptides, GLP-1 and GLP-2 are prototype peptide hormones released from gut endocrine cells in response to nutrient ingestion that regulate not only energy absorption and disposal, but also cell proliferation and survival. GLP-1 expands islet mass by stimulating pancreatic beta-cell proliferation and induction of islet neogenesis. GLP-1 also promotes cell differentiation, from exocrine cells or immature islet progenitors, toward a more differentiated beta-cell phenotype. GLP-2 stimulates cell proliferation in the gastrointestinal mucosa, leading to expansion of the normal mucosal epithelium, or attenuation of intestinal injury in experimental models of intestinal disease. Both GLP-1 and GLP-2 exert antiapoptotic actions in vivo, resulting in preservation of beta-cell mass and gut epithelium, respectively. Furthermore, GLP-1 and GLP-2 promote direct resistance to apoptosis in cells expressing GLP-1 or GLP-2 receptors. Moreover, an increasing number of structurally related peptide hormones and neuropeptides exert cytoprotective effects through G protein-coupled receptor activation in diverse cell types. Hence, peptide hormones, as exemplified by GLP-1 and GLP-2, may prove to be useful adjunctive tools for enhancement of cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and cytoprotection for the treatment of human disease."

EPIs inhibit the growth of epithelial cells but induce them to secrete the neutrophil attractant IL-8, while PEPI blocks neutrophil activation by tumor necrosis factor, preventing release of oxidants and proteases. SLPI and PEPI form complexes, preventing elastase from converting PEPI to EPIs. Supplying PEPI corrects the wound-healing defect in SLPI null mice.

We previously showed that GRN is neurotrophic in vitro. Here, we used an in vivo axonal outgrowth system and observed a delayed recovery in GRN-/- mice after facial nerve injury. This deficit was rescued by reintroduction of human GRN and relied on its C-terminus and on neuronal GRN production. Transcriptome analysis of the facial motor nucleus post injury identified cathepsin D (CTSD) as the most upregulated gene. In aged GRN-/- cortices, CTSD was also upregulated, but the relative CTSD activity was reduced and improved upon exogenous GRN addition. Moreover, GRN and its C-terminal granulin domain granulinE (GrnE) both stimulated the proteolytic activity of CTSD in vitro. Pull-down experiments confirmed a direct interaction between GRN and CTSD. This interaction was also observed with GrnE and stabilized the CTSD enzyme at different temperatures. Investigating the importance of this interaction for axonal regeneration in vivo we found that, although individually tolerated, a combined reduction of GRN and CTSD synergistically reduced axonal outgrowth. Our data links the neurotrophic effect of GRN and GrnE with a lysosomal chaperone function on CTSD to maintain its proteolytic capacity."

The aim of this study was to determine plasma levels of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide in normal subjects and in patients with essential hypertension, cardiac transplant and chronic renal failure, using radioimmunoassays directed towards the mid-portion pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) and pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (1-30) of the N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide (99-126). The circulating form(s) of the immunoreactive N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in plasma extracts has been investigated using all three radioimmunoassays by means of gel filtration chromatography to further clarify the major immunoreactive molecular circulating form(s) of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in man. 2. The plasma level (mean +/- SEM) of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) in the normal subjects was 547.2 +/- 32.7 pg/ml (n = 36) and was significantly elevated in patients with essential hypertension (730.2 +/- 72.3 pg/ml, P < 0.025, n = 39), in cardiac transplant recipients (3214.0 +/- 432.2 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 9) and in patients with chronic renal failure (3571.8 +/- 474.1 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 11). Plasma levels of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (1-30) and atrial natriuretic peptide were similarly elevated in the same patient groups when compared with the mean plasma values in the normal subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins. Direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 revealed that kaliuretic peptide > long-acting natriuretic peptide > vessel dilator increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, whereas ANF did not have any effect. Of interest, angiotensin II and ouabain inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were also completely blocked by naproxen."

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption."

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively.

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

Vessel dilator did not decrease plasma aldosterone levels. Kaliuretic peptide, ANF and long acting natriuretic peptide also decreased (P < 0.01) urinary aldosterone concentrations. None of these peptides changed the plasma potassium concentration. We conclude that two new peptide hormones (long acting natriuretic peptide and kaliuretic peptide) inhibit aldosterone secretion. The length of time that aldosterone secretion is inhibited following kaliuretic peptide and long acting natriuretic peptide infusion is significantly longer (P < 0.001) than following ANF infusion."

Kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, vessel dilator and ANF at their 10(-11) M concentrations inhibited Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase 39.5%, 27.8%, 19.2%, and 4% respectively, in bovine renal medulla, whereas their inhibition in renal cortical membranes was 37.5%, 27.5%, 20%, and 0%, respectively.

There was no additive effect of any of these peptides with ouabain suggesting that they are interacting with the same site on the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase as ouabain. To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins. Direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 revealed that kaliuretic peptide > long-acting natriuretic peptide > vessel dilator increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, whereas ANF did not have any effect. Of interest, angiotensin II and ouabain inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were also completely blocked by naproxen."

In vivo, diuresis and natriuresis, as well as hypotension have been observed. In vitro, sodium uptake into medullary collecting duct cells was inhibited, and tone of vascular smooth muscle was reduced, associated with activation of guanylate cyclase. Such previous studies have used heterologous peptides and species, e.g., human pro-ANP1-30 or pro-ANP31-67, tested in rat, pig, or dog. The present experiments were designed to test whether rat pro-ANP1-30 or pro-ANP31-67 were natriuretic and hypotensive in rats, whether the two peptides showed specific binding to plasma membranes from rat kidney cortex or aorta, and whether they affected particulate guanylate cyclase activity in rat glomerular membranes. To extend in vitro results from the literature, the effect of human pro-ANP31-67 on transport in the rat medullary collecting duct in vivo was also tested. Although rat ANP99-126, as expected, increased diuresis and natriuresis, associated with inhibition of transport in the medullary collecting duct, in identically treated rats human pro-ANP31-67 was without effect. Similarly, only the ANP99-126 infusion resulted in reduction of arterial blood pressure. Furthermore, no diuretic, natriuretic, or hypotensive responses were observed in rats infused with either rat pro-ANP31-67 or pro-ANP1-30. In plasma membranes from rat kidney cortex or aorta, neither of the rat prosegments showed specific binding, or interference with ANP99-126 receptors. Finally, in contrast to ANP99-126, neither of the prosegments was able to increase basal guanylate cyclase activity in rat glomerular membranes. Therefore, under our experimental conditions we were unable to replicate the earlier results. This study thus does not support a regulatory role for pro-ANP fragments in blood volume or blood pressure homeostasis."

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period.

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides.

Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion.

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values. Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion. Vessel dilator did not decrease plasma aldosterone levels. Kaliuretic peptide, ANF and long acting natriuretic peptide also decreased (P < 0.01) urinary aldosterone concentrations. None of these peptides changed the plasma potassium concentration. We conclude that two new peptide hormones (long acting natriuretic peptide and kaliuretic peptide) inhibit aldosterone secretion. The length of time that aldosterone secretion is inhibited following kaliuretic peptide and long acting natriuretic peptide infusion is significantly longer (P < 0.001) than following ANF infusion."

To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins. Direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 revealed that kaliuretic peptide > long-acting natriuretic peptide > vessel dilator increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, whereas ANF did not have any effect. Of interest, angiotensin II and ouabain inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were also completely blocked by naproxen."

The aim of this study was to determine plasma levels of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide in normal subjects and in patients with essential hypertension, cardiac transplant and chronic renal failure, using radioimmunoassays directed towards the mid-portion pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) and pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (1-30) of the N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide and atrial natriuretic peptide (99-126). The circulating form(s) of the immunoreactive N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in plasma extracts has been investigated using all three radioimmunoassays by means of gel filtration chromatography to further clarify the major immunoreactive molecular circulating form(s) of N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide in man. 2. The plasma level (mean +/- SEM) of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (31-67) in the normal subjects was 547.2 +/- 32.7 pg/ml (n = 36) and was significantly elevated in patients with essential hypertension (730.2 +/- 72.3 pg/ml, P < 0.025, n = 39), in cardiac transplant recipients (3214.0 +/- 432.2 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 9) and in patients with chronic renal failure (3571.8 +/- 474.1 pg/ml, P < 0.001, n = 11). Plasma levels of N-terminal pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (1-30) and atrial natriuretic peptide were similarly elevated in the same patient groups when compared with the mean plasma values in the normal subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption."

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively. The number of binding sites per cell were 1548, 36,087, and 24,090, respectively, for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (ANF).

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

The method we applied earlier to isolate the circulating form of cardiodilatin from human blood was used to detect and analyze the biologically active, predominant form of the same polypeptide family excreted by the kidneys. Each step of the isolation procedure was followed up by a bioassay using an in vitro vascular smooth muscle relaxation test and a highly specific RIA against cardiodilatin (CDD-99-126) for the initial purification steps. The polypeptides excreted in 1000 l of normal human urine were adsorbed to 2.5 kg of alginic acid, and after elution and lyophilization processed on a G-25 Sephadex column. The obtained crude polypeptide fractions were applied to ion-exchange chromatography. Thereafter four steps of HPLC were carried out to purify the polypeptide which was the suggested form of cardiodilatin (CDD) in human urine. The amino acid analysis and gas phase sequence analysis showed that the main form of urinary cardiodilatin is a 32 amino acid residue containing molecule, cardiodilatin-95-126. The molecule is N-terminally extended compared to the circulating CDD-99-126. This suggests that the analyzed urinary peptide is not the residual plasma form, filtrated and renally cleared from blood, but probably a polypeptide produced and processed in the kidney tubules and cleaved by a different postranslational process. Therefore, this vasorelaxant polypeptide is called urodilatin."

To determine if urodilatin binding sites are present in rat and human kidney, we evaluated the effect of urodilatin on iodine-125-labeled atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (100 pM) binding to tissue sections using an in situ autoradiographic technique. 125I-ANP binding occurred primarily in glomeruli and medullary structures of both rat and human kidney. Increasing concentrations of urodilatin yielded a monophasic displacement of 125I-ANP binding with an IC50 of 4.2 nM, a value nearly identical to that achieved with unlabeled ANP (7.2 nM). In additional experiments, rat glomeruli and inner medullary collecting duct cells were isolated and incubated in vitro with either ANP or urodilatin (10(-11) to 10(-6) M) and cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate accumulation measured by radioimmunoassay. Dose-response curves for the two peptides were superimposable in each tissue; at 10(-6) M, ANP generated 613 +/- 41 and urodilatin 603 +/- 55 fmol cyclic guanosine monophosphate per 10 minutes per milligram protein in inner medullary collecting duct cells (p = NS). Thus, urodilatin is as effective as ANP in displacing 125I-ANP binding to both rat and human renal tissue and in generating cyclic guanosine monophosphate in renal target cells in the rat, suggesting that its physiological effects may occur through the same receptors and signaling pathways that mediate the actions of ANP."

The high-salt meal produced a postprandial natriuresis (urinary sodium excretion from 59.0 to a peak rate of 204.6 mumol/min in 3rd h after ingestion of meal) and chloride excretion. In parallel, the urinary excretion of urodilatin increased from 35.7 to a peak rate of 105 fmol/min. The effect of high-salt intake on urinary sodium, chloride, and urodilatin excretion was significant (analysis of variance, P < 0.01), and close significant correlations were observed between urodilatin and sodium excretion (mean R = 0.702) as well as between urodilatin and chloride excretion (mean R = 0.776). In contrast, plasma ANP, which was acutely elevated 15 min after high-salt intake, was already back to low-salt values 1 h later. It did not parallel the postprandial natriuretic profile, and no positive correlation between plasma ANP and sodium excretion was observed.

Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion.

Kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, vessel dilator and ANF at their 10(-11) M concentrations inhibited Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase 39.5%, 27.8%, 19.2%, and 4% respectively, in bovine renal medulla, whereas their inhibition in renal cortical membranes was 37.5%, 27.5%, 20%, and 0%, respectively. Ouabain (0.5 mM) inhibited kidney medullary Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase 45% and in the cortex, 38%. There was no additive effect of any of these peptides with ouabain suggesting that they are interacting with the same site on the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase as ouabain. To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins. Direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 revealed that kaliuretic peptide > long-acting natriuretic peptide > vessel dilator increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, whereas ANF did not have any effect. Of interest, angiotensin II and ouabain inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were also completely blocked by naproxen."

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption."

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively. The number of binding sites per cell were 1548, 36,087, and 24,090, respectively, for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (ANF).

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

ANP exerts a potent lipolytic effect via cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK)-I mediated-stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Activation of the ANP/cGK signaling cascade also promotes muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation. Here we demonstrate that ANP regulates lipid metabolism and oxygen utilization in differentiated human adipocytes by activating the alpha2 subunit of AMPK. ANP treatment increased lipolysis by seven fold and oxygen consumption by two fold, both of which were attenuated by inhibition of AMPK activity. ANP-induced lipolysis was shown to be mediated by the alpha2 subunit of AMPK as introduction of dominant-negative alpha2 subunit of AMPK attenuated ANP effects on lipolysis. ANP-induced activation of AMPK enhanced mitochondrial oxidative capacity as evidenced by a two fold increase in oxygen consumption and induction of mitochondrial genes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1a) by 1.4-fold, cytochrome C (CytC) by 1.3-fold, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) by 1.4-fold. Treatment of human adipocytes with fatty acids and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) induced insulin resistance and down-regulation of mitochondrial genes, which was restored by ANP treatment. These results show that ANP regulates lipid catabolism and enhances energy dissipation through AMPK activation in human adipocytes."

Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively. The number of binding sites per cell were 1548, 36,087, and 24,090, respectively, for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (ANF).

Activation of β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) can induce a functional ""brown-like"" adipocyte phenotype. As cardiac natriuretic peptides (NPs) and β-AR agonists are similarly potent at stimulating lipolysis in human adipocytes, we investigated whether NPs could induce human and mouse adipocytes to acquire brown adipocyte features, including a capacity for thermogenic energy expenditure mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). In human adipocytes, atrial NP (ANP) and ventricular NP (BNP) activated PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and UCP1 expression, induced mitochondriogenesis, and increased uncoupled and total respiration. At low concentrations, ANP and β-AR agonists additively enhanced expression of brown fat and mitochondrial markers in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. Mice exposed to cold temperatures had increased levels of circulating NPs as well as higher expression of NP signaling receptor and lower expression of the NP clearance receptor (Nprc) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT). NPR-C(-/-) mice had markedly smaller WAT and BAT depots but higher expression of thermogenic genes such as Ucp1. Infusion of BNP into mice robustly increased Ucp1 and Pgc-1α expression in WAT and BAT, with corresponding elevation of respiration and energy expenditure. These results suggest that NPs promote ""browning"" of white adipocytes to increase energy expenditure, defining the heart as a central regulator of adipose tissue biology."

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

Hormone pharmacology and application to solid phase screening of synthetic peptide antisera.,"Bennett, B. et al.",1660465,10.1016/s0021-9258(18)54463-x,,1660465,"The natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) are a family of three cell surface glycoproteins, each with a single transmembrane domain. Two of these receptors, designated NPR-A and NPR-B, are membrane guanylyl cyclases that synthesize cGMP in response to hormone stimulation. The third receptor, NPR-C, has been reported to function in the metabolic clearance of ligand and in guanylyl cyclase-independent signal transduction. We engineered three chimeric proteins consisting of the natriuretic peptide receptor extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG-gamma 1. These molecules provide material for detailed studies of the human receptor's extracellular domain structure and interaction with the three human natriuretic peptides, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and type-C natriuretic peptide (CNP). The homodimeric fusion proteins, designated A-IgG, B-IgG, and C-IgG, were secreted from Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by protein-A affinity chromatography. We present here the primary characterization of these fusion proteins as represented by the intrinsic hormone affinities measured by saturation binding and competition assays. The dissociation constant of 125I-ANP for A-IgG was 1.6 pM and for C-IgG, 1.2 pM. The dissociation constant of 125I-Y0-CNP (CNP with addition of tyrosine at the amino terminus) for B-IgG was 23 pM. The rank order of potency in competitive binding for A-IgG was ANP greater than BNP much greater than CNP, whereas for B-IgG the ranking was CNP much greater than ANP greater than BNP. For C-IgG, we observed ANP greater than CNP greater than or equal to BNP. These data demonstrate that the receptor-IgG fusion proteins discriminate among the natriuretic peptides in the same manner as the native receptors and provide a basis for future structural studies with these molecules. The purified fusion proteins have a variety of potential applications, one of which we illustrate by a solid phase screening assay in which rabbit sera from a series of synthetic-peptide immunizations were titered for receptor reactivity and selectivity."

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values. Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion. Vessel dilator did not decrease plasma aldosterone levels. Kaliuretic peptide, ANF and long acting natriuretic peptide also decreased (P < 0.01) urinary aldosterone concentrations. None of these peptides changed the plasma potassium concentration. We conclude that two new peptide hormones (long acting natriuretic peptide and kaliuretic peptide) inhibit aldosterone secretion. The length of time that aldosterone secretion is inhibited following kaliuretic peptide and long acting natriuretic peptide infusion is significantly longer (P < 0.001) than following ANF infusion."

To determine if urodilatin binding sites are present in rat and human kidney, we evaluated the effect of urodilatin on iodine-125-labeled atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (100 pM) binding to tissue sections using an in situ autoradiographic technique. 125I-ANP binding occurred primarily in glomeruli and medullary structures of both rat and human kidney. Increasing concentrations of urodilatin yielded a monophasic displacement of 125I-ANP binding with an IC50 of 4.2 nM, a value nearly identical to that achieved with unlabeled ANP (7.2 nM). In additional experiments, rat glomeruli and inner medullary collecting duct cells were isolated and incubated in vitro with either ANP or urodilatin (10(-11) to 10(-6) M) and cyclic guanosine-3',5'-monophosphate accumulation measured by radioimmunoassay. Dose-response curves for the two peptides were superimposable in each tissue; at 10(-6) M, ANP generated 613 +/- 41 and urodilatin 603 +/- 55 fmol cyclic guanosine monophosphate per 10 minutes per milligram protein in inner medullary collecting duct cells (p = NS). Thus, urodilatin is as effective as ANP in displacing 125I-ANP binding to both rat and human renal tissue and in generating cyclic guanosine monophosphate in renal target cells in the rat, suggesting that its physiological effects may occur through the same receptors and signaling pathways that mediate the actions of ANP."

Their potent natriuretic-diuretic activities indicate their key role in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume and electrolyte balance. Furthermore, human and rat cDNAs encoding their precursor have been cloned and identified. Natriuretic-diuretic activity in human atrial extract comprises three distinct components (alpha, relative molecular mass (Mr) approximately 3,000; beta, Mr approximately 6,000; gamma, Mr approximately 13,000). However, only the 3,000-Mr peptide, alpha-human atrial polypeptide (alpha-hANP), comprising 28 amino acids, has so far been identified. We report here the purification and sequence analysis of two novel hANPs of higher Mr, beta- and gamma-hANP, both of which exhibit natriuretic and hypotensive activity. gamma-hANP, composed of 126 amino acids, carries the alpha-hANP sequence at its carboxy terminus. The identification of gamma-hANP reveals that the peptide, being the largest form of hANP, is processed directly from a 151-residue precursor by removal of a 26-residue signal peptide. In contrast, beta-hANP (56 residues) comprises an anti-parallel dimer of alpha-hANP; such a dimeric peptide possessing bioactivity has never been found in the tissue as an endogenous entity."

Kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, vessel dilator and ANF at their 10(-11) M concentrations inhibited Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase 39.5%, 27.8%, 19.2%, and 4% respectively, in bovine renal medulla, whereas their inhibition in renal cortical membranes was 37.5%, 27.5%, 20%, and 0%, respectively. Ouabain (0.5 mM) inhibited kidney medullary Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase 45% and in the cortex, 38%. There was no additive effect of any of these peptides with ouabain suggesting that they are interacting with the same site on the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase as ouabain. To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins. Direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 revealed that kaliuretic peptide > long-acting natriuretic peptide > vessel dilator increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, whereas ANF did not have any effect. Of interest, angiotensin II and ouabain inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were also completely blocked by naproxen."

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

In circulation, the proteolytic inactivation of ANP has been demonstrated to involve both membrane metalloendopeptidase and an aprotonin-sensitive activity, probably corresponding to kallikrein [Vanneste, Y., Pauwels, S., Lambotte, L., Michel, A., Dimaline, R. & Deschodt-Lanckman, M. (1990) Biochem. J. 269, 801-806]. In the present study, we focused on the aprotinin-sensitive pathway of ANP metabolism. In order to identify the cleavage sites recognized by kallikrein within the sequence of the hormone, tissue kallikrein was purified to homogeneity from human urine and the degradation of human ANP by the enzyme preparation was studied. Our results demonstrate that both intact and Cys7-Phe8-cleaved ANP, the initial metabolite produced in circulation by the metallo-endopeptidase, are substrates in vitro for purified tissue kallikrein. However, the Cys-Phe-cleaved peptide was degraded approximately fourfold faster than the intact hormone by the purified enzyme. The first degradation step of ANP by tissue kallikrein involves two cleavages occurring at the bonds Arg3-Arg4 and Gly16-Ala17, generating an inactive, open-ring metabolite. Incubation of ANP for a longer period with the enzyme led to the generation of several additional degradation fragments. Ten peaks were separated by HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis. The results allowed the identification of a total of eight peptide bonds susceptible to hydrolysis by tissue kallikrein in the sequence of ANP: Arg3-Arg4, Ser5-Ser6, Cys7-Phe8, Arg11-Met12, Gly16-Ala17, Gly20-Leu21, Ser25-Phe26 and Arg27-Tyr28. These results indicate that the aprotinin-sensitive activity involved in the metabolism of ANP in circulation could correspond to tissue kallikrein. However, clear identification of ANP as a novel physiological substrate of the enzyme will need further investigation."

In cardiac myocytes, ANP is synthesized as a precursor, pro-ANP, that is converted to biologically active ANP by an unknown membrane-associated protease. Recently, we cloned a transmembrane serine protease, corin, that is highly expressed in the heart. In this study, we examine effects of corin on pro-ANP processing. Our results show that recombinant human corin converts pro-ANP to ANP and that the cleavage in pro-ANP by corin is highly sequence specific. Our findings suggest that corin is the long-sought pro-ANP-converting enzyme and that the corin-mediated pro-ANP activation may play a role in regulating blood pressure."

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values. Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion. Vessel dilator did not decrease plasma aldosterone levels. Kaliuretic peptide, ANF and long acting natriuretic peptide also decreased (P < 0.01) urinary aldosterone concentrations.

To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins.

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption."

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively. The number of binding sites per cell were 1548, 36,087, and 24,090, respectively, for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (ANF). Each peptide bound to DDT1 MF-2 membranes between 10(-8) to 10(-11) M but could only bind to the other peptides' receptors at concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-7)M. These results suggest that proANF(1-30) and proANF(31-67) do not work through the ANF receptor but rather have their own separate and distinct receptors that mediate their biologic effects."

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values. Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion. Vessel dilator did not decrease plasma aldosterone levels. Kaliuretic peptide, ANF and long acting natriuretic peptide also decreased (P < 0.01) urinary aldosterone concentrations. None of these peptides changed the plasma potassium concentration. We conclude that two new peptide hormones (long acting natriuretic peptide and kaliuretic peptide) inhibit aldosterone secretion. The length of time that aldosterone secretion is inhibited following kaliuretic peptide and long acting natriuretic peptide infusion is significantly longer (P < 0.001) than following ANF infusion."

Kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, vessel dilator and ANF at their 10(-11) M concentrations inhibited Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase 39.5%, 27.8%, 19.2%, and 4% respectively, in bovine renal medulla, whereas their inhibition in renal cortical membranes was 37.5%, 27.5%, 20%, and 0%, respectively. Ouabain (0.5 mM) inhibited kidney medullary Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase 45% and in the cortex, 38%. There was no additive effect of any of these peptides with ouabain suggesting that they are interacting with the same site on the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase as ouabain. To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins. Direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 revealed that kaliuretic peptide > long-acting natriuretic peptide > vessel dilator increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, whereas ANF did not have any effect. Of interest, angiotensin II and ouabain inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were also completely blocked by naproxen."

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption."

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively. The number of binding sites per cell were 1548, 36,087, and 24,090, respectively, for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (ANF). Each peptide bound to DDT1 MF-2 membranes between 10(-8) to 10(-11) M but could only bind to the other peptides' receptors at concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-7)M. These results suggest that proANF(1-30) and proANF(31-67) do not work through the ANF receptor but rather have their own separate and distinct receptors that mediate their biologic effects."

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values. Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion. Vessel dilator did not decrease plasma aldosterone levels. Kaliuretic peptide, ANF and long acting natriuretic peptide also decreased (P < 0.01) urinary aldosterone concentrations. None of these peptides changed the plasma potassium concentration. We conclude that two new peptide hormones (long acting natriuretic peptide and kaliuretic peptide) inhibit aldosterone secretion. The length of time that aldosterone secretion is inhibited following kaliuretic peptide and long acting natriuretic peptide infusion is significantly longer (P < 0.001) than following ANF infusion."

There was no additive effect of any of these peptides with ouabain suggesting that they are interacting with the same site on the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase as ouabain. To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins. Direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 revealed that kaliuretic peptide > long-acting natriuretic peptide > vessel dilator increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, whereas ANF did not have any effect. Of interest, angiotensin II and ouabain inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were also completely blocked by naproxen."

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption."

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively.

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values. Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion. Vessel dilator did not decrease plasma aldosterone levels. Kaliuretic peptide, ANF and long acting natriuretic peptide also decreased (P < 0.01) urinary aldosterone concentrations.

Ouabain (0.5 mM) inhibited kidney medullary Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase 45% and in the cortex, 38%. There was no additive effect of any of these peptides with ouabain suggesting that they are interacting with the same site on the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase as ouabain. To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins. Direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 revealed that kaliuretic peptide > long-acting natriuretic peptide > vessel dilator increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, whereas ANF did not have any effect. Of interest, angiotensin II and ouabain inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were also completely blocked by naproxen."

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period.

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively. The number of binding sites per cell were 1548, 36,087, and 24,090, respectively, for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (ANF).

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

Thirty healthy human subjects were studied following infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 min of each of the respective peptides. Kaliuretic peptide decreased plasma aldosterone concentration by the greatest amount (6-fold) and plasma aldosterone was still significantly decreased (P < 0.001) three hours after stopping the infusion. In contrast, within 30 min of cessation of the ANF infusion, plasma aldosterone levels had returned to pre-infusion values. Long acting natriuretic peptide also significantly (P < 0.01) decreased plasma aldosterone levels which remained significantly (P < 0.001) decreased 3 h after cessation of infusion. Vessel dilator did not decrease plasma aldosterone levels. Kaliuretic peptide, ANF and long acting natriuretic peptide also decreased (P < 0.01) urinary aldosterone concentrations.

There was no additive effect of any of these peptides with ouabain suggesting that they are interacting with the same site on the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase as ouabain. To help elucidate the mechanism of these peptides' interaction with Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, naproxen (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis, and direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 by RIA were used. Naproxen completely blocked the inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase by kaliuretic peptide, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and vessel dilator suggesting that their inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in both the kidney medulla and cortex are mediated by prostaglandins. Direct measurement of prostaglandin E2 revealed that kaliuretic peptide > long-acting natriuretic peptide > vessel dilator increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis, whereas ANF did not have any effect. Of interest, angiotensin II and ouabain inhibition of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase were also completely blocked by naproxen."

These 4 peptide hormones consisting of aa 1 to 30 (ie, long-acting natriuretic peptide [LANP]), aa 31 to 67 (vessel dilator), aa 79 to 98 (kaliuretic peptide), and aa 99 to 126 (ie, ANP) have diuretic, natriuretic, and/or kaliuretic properties. ANP has been reported to have its natriuretic and protein-excreting effects via both the proximal and distal tubules, but where in the kidney the other three peptide hormones have their natriuretic and/or diuretic effects is unknown. Further, it has never been investigated as to whether these three other peptide hormones enhance protein excretion. The present investigation was designed to determine (1) if these atrial peptides enhance protein excretion and (2) if their effects involve the proximal tubules of healthy humans by examining the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin, a marker of proximal tubule function. Twenty-four healthy human subjects were studied following the infusion of 100 ng/kg body weight/min for 60 minutes of each of the respective peptides. LANP enhanced the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin 2-fold within 20 minutes of beginning its infusion (P < .05) and was 2.5-fold higher than the preinfusion excretion rate at the end of the infusion. The excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin continued to be significantly (P < .01) increased for 3 hours after cessation of the LANP infusion, with the maximal excretion rate (ie, 3.8-fold increase) at 2.5 hours after stopping the infusion. Vessel dilator showed a more marked enhancement of beta2-microglobulin during its infusion, with the excretion rate increasing 2.5-fold at 20 minutes, and was increased 4-fold (P < .01) at the end of the infusion. With cessation of the vessel dilator infusion, the excretion rate of beta2-microglobulin decreased but was still elevated 2-fold (P < .05) 3 hours after stopping the infusion. Kaliuretic peptide enhanced the beta2-microglobulin excretion rate a maximal 3-fold, which occurred at the end of its infusion. The beta2-microglobulin excretion secondary to kaliuretic peptide remained 2-fold (P < .05) above baseline during the 3-hour postinfusion period. These peptide hormones similarly enhanced the albumin and total protein excretion rates 2- to 4-fold. These results indicate that LANP, vessel dilator, and kaliuretic peptide each (1) enhance protein excretion in healthy humans and (2) inhibit proximal tubular protein reabsorption."

Since water immersion to the neck (NI) provides an acute central volume expansion identical to that produced by 2 liters of saline but without plasma compositional change, immersion to the neck was used to assess the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the ANF prohormone response to acute central blood volume expansion in seven seated sodium-replete normal subjects. Both the C terminus, which contains amino acids 99-126 and is identical to ANF, and the whole N terminus (i.e., amino acids 1-98) increased promptly with NI and peaked after 1 hr of immersion. A Mr 3900 peptide from the midportion of the N terminus consistent with amino acids 31-67 (i.e., pro-ANF-31-67) also increased with NI and followed a pattern of increasing circulating concentration nearly identical to that of the whole N terminus of the prohormone, except that its maximal concentration was at the second hour of the 3 hr of NI. With cessation of immersion, ANF decreased to preimmersion levels within 1 hr whereas the N terminus and pro-ANF-31-67, although their circulating concentrations were decreasing, were still significantly elevated at 1 hr. These findings suggest that the increase in plasma ANF, the N terminus of the ANF prohormone, and pro-ANF-31-67 from the midportion of the N terminus, with natriuretic properties similar to ANF, contribute to the natriuretic response to NI, implying a physiologic role for these atrial peptides in modulating volume homeostasis in humans."

Smooth muscle is a known biologic target of these peptides. Competitive binding experiments revealed that proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (i.e., C-terminus; ANF) each had specific and separate binding sites. The dissociation constants for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) binding were 0.11 nM, 4 nM, and 7.3 nM, respectively. The binding site concentrations for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and ANF were 2.57, 59.91 and 40 fmols/10(6) cells, respectively. The number of binding sites per cell were 1548, 36,087, and 24,090, respectively, for proANFs (1-30), (31-67), and (99-126) (ANF). Each peptide bound to DDT1 MF-2 membranes between 10(-8) to 10(-11) M but could only bind to the other peptides' receptors at concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-7)M. These results suggest that proANF(1-30) and proANF(31-67) do not work through the ANF receptor but rather have their own separate and distinct receptors that mediate their biologic effects."

To determine if these atrial natriuretic peptides are directly related to blood pressure in clinically healthy normotensive humans, we obtained 24-h profiles of vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, ANF, and blood pressure in 10 men in 1988 and 11 men in 1993 (seven men were studied twice) to compare circulating concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptides with naturally occurring changes in blood pressure. Overall, vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF each had significant (p<0.001) circadian rhythms, with peak concentrations late during sleep (at 04:00 h) being nearly twice their concentrations in the afternoon and evening. This high-amplitude circadian change allowed for the refinement of normal limits for ANF peptides by computing 3-hourly tolerance intervals (chronodesms) against which to compare time-specified single samples for normality. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure also had significant circadian rhythms (p<0.001) with peaks and troughs that were exactly opposite those of the ANF peptides. In addition to this inverse temporal relationship, there was a significant inverse correlation between absolute values for blood pressure and each ANF peptide (p<0.001), implying a functional relationship. These data suggest that in addition to other well-established neurochemical factors, the ANF peptides (vessel dilator, long-acting natriuretic peptide, and ANF) are important for the maintenance of blood pressure and modulation of its circadian rhythm."

The arginated form of ASP, i.e. complement C3a (C3a), stimulates immunological responses in human granulocytes, mast cells, guinea pig platelets and guinea pig macrophages; however, ASP is inactive in stimulating these responses. Thus both ASP and C3a are bioactive across species but are not functionally interchangeable. Tertiary structure of both proteins by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy predicts a tightly linked core region consisting of three alpha-helices linked via three disulphide bonds, with one of the alpha-helices extending out from the core and terminating in a flexible conformationally irregular carboxy-tail region. The present studies were undertaken in order to define the functionally active domains of ASP, distinctive from those of C3a, using chemical modifications, enzymic cleavage and synthetic peptide fragments. The results indicate that: (i) the N-terminal region (<10 amino acids) plays little role in ASP receptor binding and triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation; (ii) the native C-terminal region had no activity, but modifications which increased hydrophobicity increased receptor binding, and led to some activation of triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation; (iii) an intact disulphide-linked core region is essential for triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation activity but not for receptor interaction. Finally, basic charges in the carboxy region (His) are essential for ASP triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation but not for receptor binding, whereas both functions are eliminated by the modification of Lys in the disulphide-linked core region. The present results suggest that there are two functional domains in ASP, one that is responsible for the initial binding to the cell surface receptor, and a second domain that activates and increases triacylglycerol synthesis stimulation. This contrasts markedly with the structure-function studies of C3a where both binding competency and function were dependent on the C-terminal Arg. Thus ASP demonstrates distinct bioactivity."

The purpose of the present in vitro study was to examine the effect of ASP on glucose transport in muscle cells. ASP stimulated 2-deoxy-glucose transport (2-DG) in differentiated rat L6 myotubes in a time (30 min to 24 h) and concentration dependent manner (97% increase). The magnitude of the ASP effect on glucose transport was comparable to the time- and concentration-dependent effects seen with insulin (125% increase), but was additive to insulin, pointing to involvement of differential signalling pathways. ASP stimulation was dependent on cell differentiation in that glucose transport increased by only 12% in myoblasts, comparable to the effect of insulin in myoblasts (15% increase) demonstrating selective responsiveness of the differentiated myotubes to ASP and insulin. The mechanism for the ASP induced increase in glucose transport was also examined. ASP increased the Vmax for 2-DG transport by 183% (4.02 vs. 1.42 nmol/mg cell protein/30 s; ASP vs. Control, respectively). This could be explained by an increased translocation of glucose transporters (GLUT 1, GLUT 4 and GLUT 3) to the plasma membrane surface as demonstrated by Western analysis (+43% P < 0.05, +30% P < 0.05, and +49% P < 0.05, respectively). The effects of ASP were equal to those of insulin (+47%, +26% and +53% for GLUT 1, GLUT 4 and GLUT 3, respectively) and in all cases were paralleled by comparable glucose transport increases under the same incubation conditions. After long-term stimulation (24 h), Western analysis indicated that ASP had a permissive effect on insulin stimulated increases in total GLUT3 and GLUT4 cellular transporter content. These results suggest that muscle is also responsive to ASP and that ASP may play a role in glucose metabolism in both muscle and adipose tissue."

In mice, C5L2 is expressed in all adipose tissues, at levels comparable with other tissues.

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis."

These molecules have broad-spectrum killing activity against microbes and can have effects on specific mammalian cell types, potentially stimulating additional immune defense through direct chemotactic activity or induction of cytokine release. In humans, the cathelicidin hCAP18/LL-37 is processed to LL-37 in neutrophils, but on skin it can be further proteolytically processed to shorter forms. The influence of these cathelicidin peptides on keratinocyte function is not known. In the current study, DNA microarray analysis and confirmatory protein analysis showed that LL-37 affects the expression of several chemokines and cytokines by keratinocytes. Analysis of a synthetic peptide library derived from LL-37 showed that antimicrobial activity against bacterial, fungal, and viral skin pathogens resides within specific domains of the parent peptide, but antimicrobial activity does not directly correlate with the ability to stimulate IL-8 production in keratinocytes. IL-8 release was induced by d- and l-amino acid forms of cathelicidin and correlated with membrane permeability, suggesting that highly structure-specific binding to a cell surface receptor is not likely. However, this effect was inhibited by either pertussis toxin or AG1478, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, suggesting that cathelicidin may indirectly stimulate multiple signaling pathways associated with cell surface receptors. Taken together, these observations suggest that proteolytic processing may alter the balance between cathelicidin antimicrobial and host immunostimulatory functions."

They also have diverse biological functions in wound healing, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation, where it has also been demonstrated that they have a high affinity to interact with human lipid signaling molecules. Within bacterial biofilms, quorum sensing (QS), the vital bacterial cell-to-cell communication system, is maintained by similar diffusible small molecules which control phenotypic traits, virulence factors, biofilm formation, and dispersion. Efficient eradication of bacterial biofilms is of particular importance as these colonies greatly help individual cells to tolerate antibiotics and develop antimicrobial resistance. Regarding the antibacterial function, for several HDPs, including the human cathelicidin LL-37, affinity to eradicate biofilms can exceed their activity to kill individual bacteria. However, related underlying molecular mechanisms have not been explored yet. Here, we employed circular dichroism (CD) and UV/VIS spectroscopic analysis, which revealed that LL-37 exhibits QS signal affinity. This archetypal representative of HDPs interacts with the <i>Pseudomonas</i> quinolone signal (PQS) molecules, producing co-assemblies with peculiar optical activity. The binding of PQS onto the asymmetric peptide chains results in chiral supramolecular architectures consisting of helically disposed, J-aggregated molecules. Besides the well-known bacterial membrane disruption activity, our data propose a novel action mechanism of LL-37. As a specific case of the so-called quorum quenching, QS signal molecules captured by the peptide are sequestered inside co-assemblies, which may interfere with the microbial QS network helping to prevent and eradicate bacterial infections."

LL-37 is considered to play an important role in the first line of defence against local infection and systemic invasion of pathogens at sites of inflammation and wounds. Understanding its mode of action may assist in the development of antimicrobial agents mimicking those of the human immune system. In vitro studies revealed that LL-37 is cytotoxic to both bacterial and normal eukaryotic cells. To gain insight into the mechanism of its non-cell-selective cytotoxicity, we synthesized and structurally and functionally characterized LL-37, its N-terminal truncated form FF-33, and their fluorescent derivatives (which retained structure and activity). The results showed several differences, between LL-37 and other native antimicrobial peptides, that may shed light on its in vivo activities. Most interestingly, LL-37 exists in equilibrium between monomers and oligomers in solution at very low concentrations. Also, it is significantly resistant to proteolytic degradation in solution, and when bound to both zwitterionic (mimicking mammalian membranes) and negatively charged membranes (mimicking bacterial membranes). The results also showed a role for the N-terminus in proteolytic resistance and haemolytic activity, but not in antimicrobial activity. The LL-37 mode of action with negatively charged membranes suggests a detergent-like effect via a 'carpet-like' mechanism. However, the ability of LL-37 to oligomerize in zwitterionic membranes might suggest the formation of a transmembrane pore in normal eukaryotic cells. To examine this possibility we used polarized attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and found that the peptide is predominantly alpha-helical and oriented nearly parallel with the surface of zwitterionic-lipid membranes. This result does not support the channel-forming hypothesis, but rather it supports the detergent-like effect."

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway."

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis."

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway."

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway."

Many of the known human antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional, with stimulatory activities such as chemotaxis while simultaneously acting as natural antibiotics. In humans, eccrine appendages express DCD and CAMP, genes encoding proteins processed into the antimicrobial peptides dermcidin and LL-37. In this study we show that after secretion onto the skin surface, the CAMP gene product is processed by a serine protease-dependent mechanism into multiple novel antimicrobial peptides distinct from the cathelicidin LL-37. These peptides show enhanced antimicrobial action, acquiring the ability to kill skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Furthermore, although LL-37 may influence the host inflammatory response by stimulating IL-8 release from keratinocytes, this activity is lost in subsequently processed peptides. Thus, a single gene product encoding an important defense molecule alters structure and function in the topical environment to shift the balance of activity toward direct inhibition of microbial colonization."

Many of the known human antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional, with stimulatory activities such as chemotaxis while simultaneously acting as natural antibiotics. In humans, eccrine appendages express DCD and CAMP, genes encoding proteins processed into the antimicrobial peptides dermcidin and LL-37. In this study we show that after secretion onto the skin surface, the CAMP gene product is processed by a serine protease-dependent mechanism into multiple novel antimicrobial peptides distinct from the cathelicidin LL-37. These peptides show enhanced antimicrobial action, acquiring the ability to kill skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Furthermore, although LL-37 may influence the host inflammatory response by stimulating IL-8 release from keratinocytes, this activity is lost in subsequently processed peptides. Thus, a single gene product encoding an important defense molecule alters structure and function in the topical environment to shift the balance of activity toward direct inhibition of microbial colonization."

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis."

Many of the known human antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional, with stimulatory activities such as chemotaxis while simultaneously acting as natural antibiotics. In humans, eccrine appendages express DCD and CAMP, genes encoding proteins processed into the antimicrobial peptides dermcidin and LL-37. In this study we show that after secretion onto the skin surface, the CAMP gene product is processed by a serine protease-dependent mechanism into multiple novel antimicrobial peptides distinct from the cathelicidin LL-37. These peptides show enhanced antimicrobial action, acquiring the ability to kill skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Furthermore, although LL-37 may influence the host inflammatory response by stimulating IL-8 release from keratinocytes, this activity is lost in subsequently processed peptides. Thus, a single gene product encoding an important defense molecule alters structure and function in the topical environment to shift the balance of activity toward direct inhibition of microbial colonization."

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis."

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway."

Many of the known human antimicrobial peptides are multifunctional, with stimulatory activities such as chemotaxis while simultaneously acting as natural antibiotics. In humans, eccrine appendages express DCD and CAMP, genes encoding proteins processed into the antimicrobial peptides dermcidin and LL-37. In this study we show that after secretion onto the skin surface, the CAMP gene product is processed by a serine protease-dependent mechanism into multiple novel antimicrobial peptides distinct from the cathelicidin LL-37. These peptides show enhanced antimicrobial action, acquiring the ability to kill skin pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Furthermore, although LL-37 may influence the host inflammatory response by stimulating IL-8 release from keratinocytes, this activity is lost in subsequently processed peptides. Thus, a single gene product encoding an important defense molecule alters structure and function in the topical environment to shift the balance of activity toward direct inhibition of microbial colonization."

We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis."

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway."

The peptide, termed kaliocin-1, and lactoferrin showed a bactericidal effect in assays performed in low-ionic-strength conditions. This is the first time that it is shown that the antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin depends on the extracellular cation concentration. The antimicrobial effect of kaliocin-1 was lower than that of human lactoferrin, but their activities were inhibited by Na(+) or K(+) in a cation concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the peptide was able to mimic native lactoferrin, inducing K(+)-efflux and a selective dissipation of the transmembrane electrical potential of Escherichia coli cells without causing extensive damage to the outer and inner bacterial membranes. In contrast, the peptide, but not lactoferrin, was able to permeabilize different ions through liposomal membranes. The hypothetical interaction of kaliocin-1 with a bacterial membrane compound is discussed based in the different ion flux induced on cellular and artificial membranes as well as data from circular dichroism assays. Kaliocin-1 was not cytotoxic and could be a suitable model for the design of analogs able to mimic the antibacterial effect of human lactoferrin."

We now report the cloning of an additional Y-type receptor, designated Y4, by homology screening of a human placental genomic library with transmembrane (TM) probes derived from the rat Y1 gene. The Y4 genomic clone encodes a predicted protein of 375 amino acids that is most homologous to Y1 receptors from human, rat, and mouse (42% overall; 55% in TM). 125I-PYY binding to transiently expressed Y4 receptors was saturable (pKd = 9.89) and displaceable by human PP family derivatives: PP (pKi = 10.25) approximately PP2-36 (pKi = 10.06) > PYY (pKi = 9.06) approximately [Leu31,Pro34]NPY (pKi = 8.95) > NPY (pKi = 8.68) > PP13-36 (pKi = 7.13) > PP31-36 (pKi = 6.46) > PP31-36 free acid (pKi < 5).

We utilized Y1 sequence information from several species to clone a novel human receptor with 43% amino acid sequence identity to human Y1 and 53% identity in the transmembrane regions. The novel receptor displays a pharmacological profile that distinguishes it from all previously described NPY family receptors. It binds PP with an affinity (Ki) of 13.8 pM, PYY with 1.44 nM, and NPY with 9.9 nM. Because these data may identify the receptor as primarily a PP receptor, we have named it PP1. In stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells the PP1 receptor inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Northern hybridization detected mRNA in colon, small intestine, pancreas, and prostate. As all three peptides are present in the gut through either endocrine release or innervation, all three peptides may be physiological ligands to the novel NPY family receptor PP1."

In this study we show that a peptide derived from the N-terminal domain of the anti-inflammatory protein annexin 1 (lipocortin 1) can activate all three FPR family members at similar concentrations. The annexin 1 peptide initiates chemotactic responses in human monocytes that express all three FPR family members and also desensitizes the cells toward subsequent stimulation with bacterial peptide agonists. Experiments using HEK 293 cells stably expressing a single FPR family member reveal that all three receptors can be activated and desensitized by the N-terminal annexin 1 peptide.

Prolonged breaches in epithelial barrier function result in inflammation and further damage; therefore, a better understanding of the epithelial restitution process has potential for improving the development of therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate that endogenous annexin A1 (ANXA1) is released as a component of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from intestinal epithelial cells, and these ANXA1-containing EVs activate wound repair circuits. Compared with healthy controls, patients with active inflammatory bowel disease had elevated levels of secreted ANXA1-containing EVs in sera, indicating that ANXA1-containing EVs are systemically distributed in response to the inflammatory process and could potentially serve as a biomarker of intestinal mucosal inflammation. Local intestinal delivery of an exogenous ANXA1 mimetic peptide (Ac2-26) encapsulated within targeted polymeric nanoparticles (Ac2-26 Col IV NPs) accelerated healing of murine colonic wounds after biopsy-induced injury. Moreover, one-time systemic administration of Ac2-26 Col IV NPs accelerated recovery following experimentally induced colitis. Together, our results suggest that local delivery of proresolving peptides encapsulated within nanoparticles may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for clinical situations characterized by chronic mucosal injury, such as is seen in patients with IBD."

We have previously shown that neutrophils deficient in the serine proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase (CG/NE neutrophils) exhibit severe defects in chemokine CXCL2 release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production when activated on immobilized immune complex. Exogenously added active CG rescues these defects, but the mechanism remains undefined. Using a protease-based proteomic approach, we found that, in vitro, the addition of exogenous CG to immune complex-stimulated CG/NE neutrophils led to a decrease in the level of cell-associated annexin A1 (AnxA1) and cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), both known inflammatory mediators. We further confirmed that, in vivo, CG was required for the extracellular release of AnxA1 and CRAMP in a subcutaneous air pouch model. In vitro, CG efficiently cleaved AnxA1, releasing the active N-terminal peptide Ac2-26, and processed CRAMP in limited fashion. Ac2-26 and CRAMP peptides enhanced the release of CXCL2 by CG/NE neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner via formyl peptide receptor (FPR) stimulation. Blockade of FPRs by an antagonist, Boc2 (t-Boc-Phe-d-Leu-Phe-d-Leu-Phe), abrogates CXCL2 release, whereas addition of FPR agonists, fMLF and F2L, relieves Boc2 inhibition. Furthermore, the addition of active CG, but not inactive CG, also relieves Boc2 inhibition. These findings suggest that CG modulates neutrophil effector functions partly by controlling the release (and proteolysis) of FPR agonists. Unexpectedly, we found that mature CRAMP, but not Ac2-26, induced ROS production through an FPR-independent pathway."

Prior to analysis, a highly complex peptide mixture is either separated on a multidimensional chromatographic system or it is first reduced in complexity by isolating sets of representative peptides. Recently, we developed a peptide isolation procedure based on diagonal electrophoresis and diagonal chromatography. We call it combined fractional diagonal chromatography (COFRADIC). In previous experiments, we used COFRADIC to identify more than 800 Escherichia coli proteins by tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis of isolated methionine-containing peptides. Here, we describe a diagonal method to isolate N-terminal peptides. This reduces the complexity of the peptide sample, because each protein has one N terminus and is thus represented by only one peptide. In this new procedure, free amino groups in proteins are first blocked by acetylation and then digested with trypsin. After reverse-phase (RP) chromatographic fractionation of the generated peptide mixture, internal peptides are blocked using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS); they display a strong hydrophobic shift and therefore segregate from the unaltered N-terminal peptides during a second identical separation step. N-terminal peptides can thereby be specifically collected for further liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS analysis. Omitting the acetylation step results in the isolation of non-lysine-containing N-terminal peptides from in vivo blocked proteins."

The degradation products were derivatized with 4-dimethylamino-azobenzene-4'-isothiocyanate and then analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and by amino-terminal analysis. The incubation of YGGFMRGL with synaptic membranes yielded YGG, YGGF, YGGFM, and MR in a manner that was linear with respect to time. The corresponding carboxyl-terminal fragments FMRGL, MRGL, and RGL could not be detected, which suggests that the degradation of YGGFMRGL by synaptic membranes occurs by carboxypeptidase activity. The incubation of YGGFMRGL with different purified peptidases produced cleavage patterns unique from that seen with synaptic membranes. Enkephalinase recognized only the Gly-Phe bond to produce YGG and FMRGL. Thermolysin recognized the Gly-Phe bond and the Phe-Met bond to yield YGG, YGGF, FMRGL, and MRGL. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) produced primarily YGGF, MR, and lesser amounts of YGGFMR and YG. The formation of YGG, YGGF, and YGGFM by synaptic membranes could be stimulated 3-fold by the addition of 30 mM NaCl and inhibited by MK-422, an ACE inhibitor, with an IC50 of 3 nM. These data suggest that ACE, a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, is the primary enzyme involved in the degradation of YGGFMRGL in brain.

By immunohistochemistry, icosapeptide immunoreactivity was localized in human pancrease exclusively to cells that also stored pancreatic polypeptide. Analytical peptide chemistry demonstrated that a peptide corresponding to the canine icosapeptide could be extracted from the pancreatic polypeptide-rich duodenal part of the human pancreas. The human pancreatic icosapeptide was isolated by acid ethanol extraction, gel filtration, anion-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The COOH-terminal sequence of the human icosapeptide is very similar to that of the canine icosapeptide, whereas none of the first nine amino acid residues are identical. When the primary structure of peptides from three different species are compared, it is apparent that the pancreatic polypeptide part of the common precursor is a well-conserved sequence as compared to the icosapeptide part, although 8 out of 11 residues in the COOH-terminal sequence of the icosapeptide are identical in all three species."

The peptide was purified sufficiently for characterization by fast atom bombardment mapping after cation-exchange and reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. The sequence of this novel peptide corresponds exactly to prepro-VIP-81-122 and has been designated peptide histidine valine 42 (PHV-42). Synthetic PHV-42 reduced both the force and frequency of spontaneous contractions of isolated rat uterus and was at least 12 times more potent than peptide histidine methionine (prepro-VIP-81-107), and over a hundred times more potent than noradrenaline. PHV-42 was also more potent than peptide histidine methionine in relaxing smooth muscle preparations of rat stomach and guinea pig trachea, but was approximately 4-fold less potent in reducing blood pressure than VIP. PHV-42 thus forms a separate subsystem in the VIP family of peptides and may be the most biologically active product of prepro-VIP in certain tissues such as the uterus and trachea."
