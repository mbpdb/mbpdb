Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity	10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 81.82; 2) 100.0	1	1) 9; 2) 11	1	1) 9; 2) 11	1) 7.37e-09; 2) 1.09e-11	1) 9; 2) 11	0	0

Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity.

From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively). The latter sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of the ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein molecule, also had antioxidant activity.

Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW.

Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.; 2) An 8-AA (8mer) fragment (PFPEVFGK) of a known antihypertensive peptide derived from bovine αS1-casein (C12 antihypertensive peptide) was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods.	1) 10.1021/jf049510t; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-10437	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 87.5	1) 1; 2) 2	8	1) 1; 2) 3	1) 7; 2) 10	1) 2.16e-06; 2) 1.04e-07	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.; 2) Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	1) 10.3390/antiox9020117; 2) 10.4014/jmb.2104.04013	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 88.24	1) 1; 2) 4	15	1	1) 12; 2) 15	1) 2.44e-16; 2) 1.96e-12	1) 12; 2) 15	0	0

In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.; 2) Milk is a nutritionally important source of bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. These compounds can be useful as ingredients of functional food. For this reason, in the last decades, bioactive peptides attracted the interest of researchers and food companies. In this work, the results obtained with six milk-derived bioactive peptides (Y-4-R, V-6-R, V-7-K, A-10-F, R-10-M, and H-9-M) synthesized and studied for their antioxidant properties in vitro and in a cellular model, are reported. These molecules correspond to peptide fragments derived from parent compounds able to cross the apical membrane of Caco-2 cell layer and released in the basolateral compartment. In vitro, antioxidant tests such as 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and crocin bleaching showed antioxidant activity mainly for peptides Y-4-R and V-6-R, respectively. In Caco-2 cells, peptides V-6-R, H-9-R, Y-4-R, and particularly R-10-M and V-7-K are able to prevent the decrease of viability due to oxidative stress. The latter peptide is also the most effective in protecting cells from lipid peroxidation.

ARHPHPHLSF	P02669	HPHPHLSF	Kappa-casein	Ovis aries	119-126	ACE-inhibitory		28.9				1) Changes in arterial blood pressure after single oral administration of milk-casein-derived peptides in spontaneously hypertensive rats; 2) Identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides from ovine milk proteins by CE-MS and chromatographic techniques	1) Miguel, M. et al.; 2) Gomez-Ruiz, JA. et al.	1) In this report, we present the use of CE-MS as complement to RP separation for the identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides from a complex milk protein hydrolysate. As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.; 2) In this study we evaluated the short-term oral antihypertensive effect of several peptide sequences isolated from casein fractions, previously characterized as in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the rats were measured by the tail cuff method before administration and also 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-administration. The sequences LVYPFTGPIPN, HLPLP, IAK, YAKPVA and WQVLPNAVPAK showed a clear decrease in SBP and DBP in SHR. HPHPHLSF caused a significant decrease of the DBP in the SHR, but this sequence did not modify the SBP of these animals in a significant manner. KKYNVPQL did not modify SBP in the SHR, and caused a slight, but significant and maintained, decrease in DBP in these animals. SBP and DBP returned to baseline values 24 h post-administration of all peptides. In conclusion, these peptides are bioactive ingredients with potential benefit in the prevention and treatment of hypertension or other associated disorders.	1) 10.1002/mnfr.200900448; 2) 10.1002/elps.200700324	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0

In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.; 2) Milk is a nutritionally important source of bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. These compounds can be useful as ingredients of functional food. For this reason, in the last decades, bioactive peptides attracted the interest of researchers and food companies. In this work, the results obtained with six milk-derived bioactive peptides (Y-4-R, V-6-R, V-7-K, A-10-F, R-10-M, and H-9-M) synthesized and studied for their antioxidant properties in vitro and in a cellular model, are reported. These molecules correspond to peptide fragments derived from parent compounds able to cross the apical membrane of Caco-2 cell layer and released in the basolateral compartment. In vitro, antioxidant tests such as 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and crocin bleaching showed antioxidant activity mainly for peptides Y-4-R and V-6-R, respectively. In Caco-2 cells, peptides V-6-R, H-9-R, Y-4-R, and particularly R-10-M and V-7-K are able to prevent the decrease of viability due to oxidative stress. The latter peptide is also the most effective in protecting cells from lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, the reported hydrolyzed peptides are shown to exert the antioxidant properties both in vitro and in a cellular model.	1) 10.1002/psc.3162; 2) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.0; 2) 90.91	1) 1; 2) 2	10	1	1) 9; 2) 10	1) 6.94e-09; 2) 2.61e-10	1) 9; 2) 10	0	0

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	1) 3.85e-05; 2) 2.77e-05	6	0	0

"1) Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.; 2) The fragment-peptides of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI12, CEI5 and CEIβ7) derived from an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein were synthesized. Val-Ala-Pro, the C-terminal tripeptide of CEI5 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro), exhibited more potent inhibitory activity (I50 = 2.0μm) than CEI5 (I50 = 6.0μm). However, d-Val-Ala-Pro showed lower inhibitory activity (I50 = 550μm). Val-Ala-Pro may be important for the inhibitory activity of CEI5. The C-terminal heptapeptide of CEI12 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys) and the short fragments of CEIβ7 (Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg) showed lower inhibitory activities than the full-length peptides.

Also, the antihypertensive activity of CEI12 and CEI5 was investigated. CEI12, intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 14.2 mg/kg, antagonized the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I.; 3) Inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme were isolated from an enzymatic hydrolysate of bovine casein. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro- Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys (CEI12), Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (CEI5), and Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg (CEIβ7). CEI5 is a penta-peptide derived from the hydrolysate of CEI12 with proline-specific endopeptidase, and CEIβ7 is a hepta-peptide derived from β-casein. These inhibitors potentiated bradykinin in the contraction of the uterus and the ileum of rats. The ileum was more sensitive to these inhibitors than the uterus. The bradykinin-potentiating activity of these inhibitors on the ileum lasted for more than 90 min even after washing the organ."	1) 10.1080/00021369.1985.10866901; 2) 10.1080/00021369.1987.10868244; 3) 10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 83.33	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 2.37e-05; 2) 5.00e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0
AVPYPQ	P02666	AVPYPQR	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	192-198	Antimicrobial			MIC	1) E. coli B. subtilis; 2) Gram negative		1) Identification of novel antibacterial peptides isolated from a commercially available casein hydrolysate by autofocusing technique; 2) Isolation and identification of some antibacterial peptides in the plasmin-digest of β-casein	1) Elbarbary, H. et al.; 2) Sedaghati, H. et al.	1) This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.; 2) Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.	1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019; 2) 10.1002/biof.1023	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0

Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.; 2) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties.

The latter peptide is also the most effective in protecting cells from lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, the reported hydrolyzed peptides are shown to exert the antioxidant properties both in vitro and in a cellular model.; 4) Human milk pepsin and pancreatin digests were separated using molecular membrane and reverse phase chromatography. Chemical screening of the resulting fractions using the ORAC antioxidant assay yielded a peptide fraction (PF-23) with high antioxidant activity (5207 μM Trolox Equivalents (TE)/g). Tandem mass spectrometry allowed the identification of twenty peptides. Eight small molecular weight peptides from 4 to 6 amino acids were synthesised and screened for antioxidant properties using ORAC and linoleic acid emulsion. On ORAC, the peptides YGYTGA (5169 μM TE/mmol) and ISELGW (4479 μM TE/mmol) were the most active. At 250 μM peptide ISELGW and its derivatives significantly reduced hydroperoxides formed during autoxidation of linoleic acid for 4 days at 50 °C. Further testing of these peptides may allow their inclusion in infant formulas to reduce the incidence of oxidative stress-mediated diseases in newborns.	1) 10.1002/psc.3162; 2) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696; 3) 10.1021/jf0003911; 4) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.11.146	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 2	6	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 2.37e-05; 2) 5.00e-04; 3) 6.95e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0

Casein-derived antioxidant peptides by using microbial proteases have gained increasing attention. Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.	10.4014/jmb.2104.04013	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 81.82; 2) 83.33	1	1) 9; 2) 10	3	1) 12; 2) 11	1) 3.50e-10; 2) 9.32e-09	1) 9; 2) 10	0	0

In this work, we studied two different preparations of peptide Asp-Lys-Ile-His-Pro (DKIHP), which were obtained by two different synthetic procedures (Boc and Fmoc). The peptide synthesized by the Boc method yielded a unique conformer, containing trans-Pro, and significant ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50 = 113.18 μM). The chromatographic and NMR data of this active conformer are reported. The peptide synthesized by Fmoc chemistry yielded three conformers, two of them containing trans-Pro and a third one containing cis-Pro, and showed a lower activity (IC50 = 577.92 μM). This was attributed to the presence of conformers with less (or none) activity. We have pointed out the importance of performing structural studies on these type of peptides before testing their ACE-inhibitory activity.; 2) A total of 75 peptides included in the fraction with molecular mass below 3000 from an 8-month-old Manchego cheese could be identified using HPLC coupled on line to an ion trap mass spectrometer. Some previously described peptides with antihypertensive and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were detected. The formation of five active sequences was followed during cheese ripening in four different batches of Manchego cheese. Two experimental batches of Manchego cheese elaborated with selected bacterial strains with the aim of improve the organoleptic characteristics demonstrated also a good performance in the formation of peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity during cheese ripening.; 3) Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	1) 10.1016/j.chroma.2004.05.022; 2) 10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000; 3) 10.1021/jf049532f	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 83.33; 2) 100.0	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 1.71e-05; 2) 5.00e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0

All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.; 2) Recently, some physiological significance of peptide fragments derived from milk proteins has been suggested. 1) It has recently been reported that synthetic peptide inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) possibly act as anti-amnestic agents. 2 ) In our previous paper,3) we described the synthesis of a number of peptide fragments of human β-casein, and found that PEP activity was inhibited by the synthetic pep tides within amino acid redidues 49-59 (Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro-Tyr) of β-casein, and the most potent inhibitor was Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-GluPro-Ile (50-57, IC50 = 8 11M)	1) 10.1007/BF02019390; 2) 10.1271/bbb.56.976	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0

In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.; 2) Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion.

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5. These results provide novel insight into the mineral transport activity of phosphopeptides obtained from casein.	10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05711	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 81.25	1	1) 16; 2) 13	4	1) 16; 2) 19	1) 2.49e-17; 2) 2.83e-13	1) 16; 2) 13	0	0

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase).

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 3) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 4) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 5) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 4) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 5) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 81.82; 3) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 3	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 1; 2) 3	1) 8; 2) 10; 3) 11	1) 3.50e-10; 2) 9.32e-09; 3) 2.43e-07	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	0	0

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase).

The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 83.33; 2) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 3	12	1	1) 12; 2) 10	1) 6.38e-13; 2) 4.20e-10	1) 12; 2) 10	0	0

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	3	14	1.57e-12	12	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 92.31; 2) 81.25	1	1) 12; 2) 13	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 14; 2) 12	1) 9.59e-13; 2) 9.24e-14	1) 12; 2) 13	0	0

Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 88.24; 3) 93.75	1	1) 12; 2) 15	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 16; 2) 12; 3) 17	1) 2.44e-16; 2) 1.96e-12; 3) 1.80e-16	1) 12; 2) 15	0	0

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 88.24; 2) 86.67	1	1) 15; 2) 13	3	1) 15; 2) 17	1) 2.44e-16; 2) 1.52e-13	1) 15; 2) 13	0	0

Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.; 2) A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	1) 10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2; 2) 10.1093/jn/131.11.2936	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 83.33; 2) 88.24	1	15	1) 4; 2) 3	1) 17; 2) 18	1) 2.44e-16; 2) 3.23e-16	15	0	0

"1) Three peptides produced by a Lactobacillus acidophilus DPC6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 12868 and Escherichia coli DPC5063 were characterized. These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 3) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity; 2) The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox.

In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 2) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042; 2) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 84.62; 2) 92.31	1) 3; 2) 2	13	1	1) 12; 2) 11	1) 9.59e-13; 2) 2.41e-11	1) 12; 2) 11	0	0

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity.

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	4	17	1	14	1) 9.22e-15; 2) 1.66e-14	14	0	0

Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.; 2) A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	1) 10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2; 2) 10.1093/jn/131.11.2936	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 83.33	1) 4; 2) 3	17	1	1) 14; 2) 15	1) 1.66e-14; 2) 6.91e-16	1) 14; 2) 15	0	0

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 94.74; 2) 84.21	1) 4; 2) 2	19	1	1) 16; 2) 18	1) 5.47e-20; 2) 3.16e-17	1) 16; 2) 18	0	0

Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 95.0; 3) 85.0	1) 4; 2) 2; 3) 5	20	1	1) 16; 2) 19; 3) 17	1) 1.34e-18; 2) 2.34e-21; 3) 3.11e-17	1) 16; 2) 19; 3) 17	0	0

"1) The fragment-peptides of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI12, CEI5 and CEIβ7) derived from an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein were synthesized. Val-Ala-Pro, the C-terminal tripeptide of CEI5 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro), exhibited more potent inhibitory activity (I50 = 2.0μm) than CEI5 (I50 = 6.0μm). However, d-Val-Ala-Pro showed lower inhibitory activity (I50 = 550μm). Val-Ala-Pro may be important for the inhibitory activity of CEI5. The C-terminal heptapeptide of CEI12 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys) and the short fragments of CEIβ7 (Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg) showed lower inhibitory activities than the full-length peptides.

Also, the antihypertensive activity of CEI12 and CEI5 was investigated. CEI12, intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 14.2 mg/kg, antagonized the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I.; 2) An 8-AA (8mer) fragment (PFPEVFGK) of a known antihypertensive peptide derived from bovine αS1-casein (C12 antihypertensive peptide) was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods."	1) 10.1080/00021369.1987.10868244; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-10437	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 100.0	1	7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 9.79e-07; 2) 1.36e-06	7	0	0

Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 2) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008; 2) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 87.5	1) 1; 2) 2	7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 6	1) 1.36e-06; 2) 2.77e-05	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0
FPGPIPN	P02666	PGPIPN	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	78-83	Anticancer	Inhibits SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell growth					1) PGPIPN, a Therapeutic Hexapeptide, Suppressed Human Ovarian Cancer Growth by Targeting BCL2; 2) Bioactive Hexapeptide Reduced the Resistance of Ovarian Cancer Cells to DDP by Affecting HSF1-HSP70 Signaling Pathway	1) Ruowen, G. et al.; 2) Wang, W. et al.	1) Bioactive peptides, either derived from nature resources or synthesized by rational design, have been demonstrated potential for therapeutic agents against numerous human diseases, including cancer. However, the mechanism of therapeutic peptides against cancer has not been well elucidated. Here we show that PGPIPN, a hexapeptide derived from bovine β-casein, inhibited the proliferation of human ovarian cancer cells line SKOV3 as well as the primary ovarian cancer cells in vitro. Consistently, PGPIPIN also decreased tumor growth rate in xenograft ovarian cancer model mice in a dose-dependent manner. Further study demonstrated that the anti-tumor effect of PGPIPN is partially through promoting cell apoptosis by inhibiting BCL2 pathway. Thus, our study suggests that PGPIPN is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of ovarian cancer or other types of cancer.; 2) Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death in gynecologic malignancies. Ovarian cancer as a metastatic malignant tumor is highly recurrent and prone to drug resistance. Bioactive peptides are an emerging area of biomedical research in reducing resistance of tumor cell to drugs. In this paper, we investigated the effects and mechanisms of bioactive hexapeptide (PGPIPN) derived in milk protein on the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (DDP). Human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and COC1), their DDP-resistant sublines (SKOV3/DDP and COC1/DDP) and human primary ovarian cancer cells were cultured in vitro under the combined treatment of DDP (close to IC50) and different concentrations of PGPIPN. The viabilities, apoptosis and cell cycle changes were respectively measured by WST-8 and flow cytometry. The mRNA and protein expression levels of HSF1, HSP70, MDR1, ERCC1 and β-actin gene were respectively assayed by RT-qPCR and western blotting. The results showed that PGPIPN significantly increased the sensitivity of human ovarian cancer cells to DDP in inhibiting viability and inducing apoptosis in vitro. But the effects in sensitive cells were lower than DDP-resistant cells. PGPIPN significantly changed the cell cycles in all human ovarian cancer cells, which leaded to a significant increase in the percentage of cells blocked at G2/M phase and decrease the percentage of cells at G1 phases in a dose-dependent manner. PGPIPN affected the expression levels of HSF1, HSP70, MDR1 and ERCC1 genes. Compared with cells in DDP treatment alone, the expression levels of HSF1 and HSP70 in human ovarian cancer cells treated with DDP and PGPIPN together significantly decreased in dose-dependent manner. PGPIPN significantly decreased MDR1 and ERCC1 of drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and human primary ovarian cancer cell in a dose-dependent manner. Pifithrin-μ (PFTμ, HSP70 inhibitor) decreased or removed the effects of peptide in increasing the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to DDP. This suggests that PGPIPN enhanced the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to DDP partially via reducing the activity of HSF1/HSP70 signaling pathway, thus inducing cell apoptosis and decreasing repairment of DNA damage.	1) 10.1371/journal.pone.0060701; 2) 10.7150/jca.62285	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 2	7	1	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 9.79e-07; 2) 3.85e-05	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0

Indeed by enzymatic digestion of the main milk proteins, the caseins, biologically active peptides are released; they may be implicated in the stimulation of the newborn's immune system. From this point of view a ‘strategic active zone’ has been characterized in β-casein. A possible role of casein as a ‘prohormone’ for the newborn is suggested.; 2) Bioactive peptides are an emerging area of biomedical research in the study of numerous human diseases, including acute alcoholic liver injury (AALI). To study the role and mechanism of the milk‑derived hexapeptide Pro‑Gly‑Pro‑Ile‑Pro‑Asn (PGPIPN) in preventing and reducing AALI, the present study established a mouse model of AALI. PGPIPN was used as a therapeutic drug, and glutathione (GSH) was used as a positive control. The body and liver weights of mice were measured, and the liver indexes were calculated to observe mice health. The pathological morphology of liver tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin were examined to analyze hepatic injury, and hepatocyte apoptosis was measured with a TUNEL assay. The concentrations or activities of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, tumor necrosis factor‑α, interleukin (IL)‑1β, IL‑6, triglyceride, total cholesterol, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase and GSH peroxidase (GSH‑PX) were detected in serum and/or liver homogenates. The 78 kDa glucose‑regulated protein (GRP78), protein kinase R‑like (PKR) endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), phosphorylated (p)‑PERK, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF‑2α), p-eIF-2α, inositol‑requiring enzyme 1α (IRE‑1α), spliced X‑box binding protein 1 (XBP‑1s), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), caspase‑3 and cleaved caspase‑3 proteins associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes were assessed by western blotting, and RNA levels of XBP‑1s, CHOP and caspase‑3 genes were assessed by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The results suggested that PGPIPN attenuated alcoholic hepatocyte damage in animal models and reduced hepatocyte oxidative stress in a dose‑dependent manner. Moreover, PGPIPN reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress by regulating the expression levels of p‑PERK, p‑eIF‑2α, XBP‑1s, CHOP, caspase‑3 and cleaved caspase‑3. Collectively, the present results indicated that PGPIPN, as a potential therapeutic drug for AALI, exerted a protective effect on the liver and could reduce liver damage.; 3) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 2) 10.1007/BF01941703; 3) 10.3892/ijmm.2020.4643	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	1) 10.3390/antiox9020117; 2) 10.4014/jmb.2104.04013	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 80.0	1	1) 14; 2) 12	1) 4; 2) 1	1) 12; 2) 17	1) 1.96e-12; 2) 8.13e-15	1) 14; 2) 12	0	0

Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity; 2) The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.; 3) Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.; 4) Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a peptidyldipeptide hydrolase (EC 3.4.15.1) which cleaves dipeptides from the Jree COOH-terminal of peptides. The enzyme hydrolyzes both angiotensin I and bradykinin, generating the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II fiom angiotensin I, and vasoinactive peptides from the vasodilator bradykinin. Inhibitors of ACE were first obtained from the venom of snakes such as Bothrops jararacal ) and Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii) Later, Oshima et a/. found peptide inhibitors of ACE in digests of gelafin with bacterial collagenase) A characteristic of these inhibitors is that they have a Pro-Pro, Ala-Pro or Ala-Hyp sequence at their COOH-terminal.

Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity; 2) The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.; 3) Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.; 4) Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a peptidyldipeptide hydrolase (EC 3.4.15.1) which cleaves dipeptides from the Jree COOH-terminal of peptides.

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.04e-07	8	0	0

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals.

This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.; 2) Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.	1) 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.05.004; 2) 10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	86.67	1	26	1	26	1.49e-29	26	0	0

This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.; 2) Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.	1) 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.05.004; 2) 10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	30	1	30	5.77e-35	30	0	0

"Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 87.5	1) 1; 2) 2	8	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 7; 2) 9	1) 1.55e-06; 2) 1.04e-07	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 3.85e-05; 2) 2.77e-05	6	0	0

As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.; 2) In this study we evaluated the short-term oral antihypertensive effect of several peptide sequences isolated from casein fractions, previously characterized as in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the rats were measured by the tail cuff method before administration and also 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-administration. The sequences LVYPFTGPIPN, HLPLP, IAK, YAKPVA and WQVLPNAVPAK showed a clear decrease in SBP and DBP in SHR. HPHPHLSF caused a significant decrease of the DBP in the SHR, but this sequence did not modify the SBP of these animals in a significant manner. KKYNVPQL did not modify SBP in the SHR, and caused a slight, but significant and maintained, decrease in DBP in these animals. SBP and DBP returned to baseline values 24 h post-administration of all peptides. In conclusion, these peptides are bioactive ingredients with potential benefit in the prevention and treatment of hypertension or other associated disorders.	1) 10.1002/mnfr.200900448; 2) 10.1002/elps.200700324	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	8	1	8	5.62e-08	8	0	0

"1) Three peptides produced by a Lactobacillus acidophilus DPC6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 12868 and Escherichia coli DPC5063 were characterized. These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.; 3) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 4) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures.

"Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes.

Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0	1) 3; 2) 2	10	1	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 1.30e-07; 2) 5.00e-09	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.; 2) Inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme were isolated from an enzymatic hydrolysate of bovine casein. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro- Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys (CEI12), Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (CEI5), and Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg (CEIβ7). CEI5 is a penta-peptide derived from the hydrolysate of CEI12 with proline-specific endopeptidase, and CEIβ7 is a hepta-peptide derived from β-casein. These inhibitors potentiated bradykinin in the contraction of the uterus and the ileum of rats. The ileum was more sensitive to these inhibitors than the uterus. The bradykinin-potentiating activity of these inhibitors on the ileum lasted for more than 90 min even after washing the organ.	1) 10.1080/00021369.1985.10866901; 2) 10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.; 2) Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides.

Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.; 2) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.	1) 10.1021/jf0003911; 2) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

KAVPYPQR	P02666	AVPYPQR	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	192-198	Antioxidant						1) Caseins and Casein Hydrolysates 2 Antioxidative Properties and Relevance to Lipoxygenase Inhibition; 2) Milk-derived bioactive peptides exhibit antioxidant activity through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway	1) Tonolo, F. et al.; 2) Rival, S. et al.	1) The antioxidant activity of caseins and casein-derived peptides was evaluated by using three free radical producing reactionsthe lipoxygenase- and AAPH-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.; 2) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.	1) 10.1021/jf0003911; 2) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

"Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.77; 2) 87.5; 3) 86.96	1	1) 21; 2) 20	4	1) 24; 2) 23	1) 1.44e-23; 2) 3.51e-22; 3) 2.45e-23	1) 21; 2) 20	0	0

This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 87.5	1) 1; 2) 2	7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 6	1) 1.36e-06; 2) 2.77e-05	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

"1) Three peptides produced by a Lactobacillus acidophilus DPC6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 12868 and Escherichia coli DPC5063 were characterized. These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.; 3) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 4) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

Significance and impact of the study: This study highlights the potential to exploit Bacillus sp. or the enzymes they produce for the generation of bioactive antimicrobial peptides from bovine casein."	1) 10.1128/AEM.07312-11; 2) 10.1002/biof.1023; 3) 10.1128/AEM.72.3.2260-2264.2006; 4) 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03271.x	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0	1	1) 8; 2) 9	2	1) 9; 2) 10	1) 1.81e-07; 2) 6.94e-09	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

"1) Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity; 2) Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.; 3) Thr-Thr-Met-Pro-Leu-Trp, the C-terminal hexapeptide of αsl-casein, inhibited the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (I50 = 16 μM). Z-Pro-Leu-Trp also inhibited the enzyme (I50 = 18 μM). The Pro- Leu-Trp sequence may be important for the inhibitory activity of this hexapeptide. Z-Pro-Val-Trp, which contains Val in place of Leu, inhibited the enzyme more potently (I50 =2.9 μM).

The antihypertensive activity of this hexapeptide was also investigated. This peptide, when intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 31.8 mg/kg, tended to antagonize the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I."	1) 10.1080/00021369.1987.10868415; 2) 10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7; 3) 10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.; 2) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins or artificial synthetic products. Further research examining the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods. Our research also demonstrates that ACE inhibitory peptide LAP may lower blood pressure with no adverse effects.; 3) Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.; 4) An optimal antihypertensive peptide (AHP), KVLPVP, was linked to form a six-copy of tandem dotetracontapeptide with the specific cleavage site (Arg-X) of clostripain. The gene of the dotetracontapeptide was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. After a 5 h induction with 1.2 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside the recombinant AHP fused with glutathione-S-transferase tag reached the maximal production, 24.6% of total intracellular protein. Following digestion with clostripain and carboxypeptidase B, the product was separated with ultrafiltration and reversed-phase HPLC, and 170 mg of pure recombinant AHP was obtained from 1 L of E. coli culture. The IC50 of the recombinant AHP was 4.6 microM. The systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats could be decreased dramatically by the recombinant AHP in a dose-dependent manner after delivering 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of body weight (BW) or 0.6 mg of AHP/kg of BW orally. The strong antihypertensive effect was reached 4-24 h after oral administration of 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of BW, and the peak point was at the fourth hour (-21.4 +/- 7.2 mm of Hg). This study overcame traditional enzymatic digestion problems in preparing AHP and established a novel approach for industrial production of AHP.; 5) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 6) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1; 2) 10.1021/jf0703248; 3) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.121; 4) 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.02.005; 5) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 6) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 87.5; 3) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 6; 3) 7	1) 1.36e-06; 2) 9.79e-07; 3) 3.85e-05; 4) 2.77e-05	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0

In the present investigation, peptides, VLPVPQ and VLPVP were generated from parent antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. Initially, all these peptides were studied in-silico for biophysical properties like hydrophobicity, structure, Extinction coefficient, isoelectric point, grand average hydropathy value and Wimley White whole residue hydrophobicity. Inspite of this, homology relationship among organisms, taxonomy, digestibility assessment for proteases, solubility, melting temperature index, half-life time in-vitro and in-vivo, instability index and aliphatic index was compared in-silico. Further, based on these properties, VLPVP was compared with parent peptide, VLPVPQK for antioxidative potential. VLPVP exhibited lesser antioxidative potential by chemical method and in-vitro hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress conditions generated in fibroblast cells compared to VLPVPQK. The proliferative potential, cell injury marker, nitric oxide production and pro-inflammatory, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α was measured to compare cytoprotective antioxidative potential. The results displayed the cytoprotective potential of VLPVPQK. In addition, the present study suggested that glutamine and lysine are responsible for the c-terminal sequence based response and cytoprotective potential of milk bioactive peptide, VLPVPQK. Other than this, hydrophobic amino acids and positive charge of the VLPVPQK is also responsible for the cytoprotective potential.; 2) Bioactive peptides have been defined as specific protein fragments that have a positive impact on body functions or conditions and may ultimately influence health. We scrutinised the antioxidative property of peptides from buffalo casein digested with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin alone and in combinations. Casein hydrolysates were subjected to ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The antioxidant properties of casein, its hydrolysates and synthetic peptides, was assessed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid). The fraction with highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) was selected for further study. TEAC of casein was 0.862 ± 0.11 μmol mg−1, while it is highest for pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates. The 1 kDa permeate of pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates possessed the highest antioxidant activity and it was resolved into 16 fractions by RP-HPLC. Antioxidant activity fraction 11 was highest and on custom sequencing yielded 4 peptides, of which the synthetic peptide VLPVPQK possessed the highest TEAC (5.71 ± 0.59 μmol mg−1).; 3) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.; 4) The antioxidant activity of caseins and casein-derived peptides was evaluated by using three free radical producing reactionsthe lipoxygenase- and AAPH-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.; 5) Milk and milk-derived products are a relevant source of bioactive peptides, which are also potential components of functional foods. Bioactive peptides exert multiple actions including an antioxidant role. In the present paper, four synthetic peptides (NPYVPR, AVPYPQR, KVLPVPEK, and ARHPHPHLSFM), corresponding to milk-derived peptides were studied. Although with different features, as revealed by RP-HPLC chromatography and MS analysis, the obtained peptides were shown to be taken up by Caco-2 cells arranged in an epithelial monolayer formation. The four peptides were all able to preserve cell viability against induced oxidative stress indicating that they might have a role in the control of oxidative stress. Therefore, an estimation of total thiols and glutathione content was performed after cell treatment with oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TbOOH). The peptides were able to prevent the decrease of both total thiols and glutathione induced by H2O2 or TbOOH, and, in addition, they showed a protective effect on the thiol-related antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase. Finally, they caused a decrease of ROS production induced by TbOOH in Caco-2 cells. The reported results highlight the relevant antioxidant role played by bioactive peptides in cells, which adds to other previously known properties.	1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2019.108816; 2) 10.1021/jf0003911; 3) 10.1039/c7fo01646h; 4) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2014.11.001	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 87.5	1) 1; 2) 2	7	1	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 3.85e-05; 2) 1.36e-06	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0

Therefore, understanding the role of specific food-derived molecules in the regulation of their specific pathways is a relevant issue. Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-α, the levels of NF-κB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-α alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-α) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.; 2) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 2) 10.3390/ijms23084382	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 100.0	1	7	1	7	1) 9.79e-07; 2) 1.36e-06	7	0	0
KVLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Osteoanabolic						1) Repertoire of Structure-Activity-Based Novel Modified Peptides Elicits Enhanced Osteogenic Potential; 2) Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation	1) Reddi, S. et al.; 2) Upadhyay, D. et al.	1) Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.; 2) Biologically active peptides in milk proteins can be used as effective dietary supplements for management of bone-associated issues including osteoporosis. A bioactive peptide derived from milk, viz. VLPVPQK/PepC, has been validated previously from our lab for its osteoanabolic action. In this study, we report 14 novel variants of PepC, designed in silico, based on the structure–activity relationship, aiming to enhance its osteogenic effect that holds tremendous therapeutic utility for bone-related injuries. PepC was computationally modified at seven positions of its original sequence, resulting in 14 modified synthetic peptides for functional predictions and in vitro assessment by comparative analysis of modified peptides by PepC for improved ability in osteogenic functional assays (proliferation potential, antioxidant ability, gene and protein expression, cytotoxic effect, bone mineralization) using calvarial osteoblasts. For most peptides with the highest Peptide7 response relative to PepC (p < 0.05), enhanced osteoanabolic response was observed. Further observations on Peptide7 have therefore been investigated in depth (qPCR, immunoblotting, LCMS/MS, and PCA analysis). Peptide7 displayed a rise in the expression of osteogenes (Osterix, Opg, Bmp2, and Runx2, p < 0.05) and protein (Runx2 and Bmp2, p < 0.05). Besides, LCMS/MS findings suggest Peptide7 escapes intestinal peptidases degradation. Experimental evidence supports an improved osteological reaction to newly modified peptides and hence exploitation in the preparation of functional foods or supplements.	1) 10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2; 2) 10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03385	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.; 2) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins or artificial synthetic products. Further research examining the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods. Our research also demonstrates that ACE inhibitory peptide LAP may lower blood pressure with no adverse effects.; 3) Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.; 4) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 5) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins.

We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation.

Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-α, the levels of NF-κB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-α alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-α) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.; 2) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 2) 10.3390/ijms23084382	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 100.0	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 5.62e-08; 2) 1.55e-06	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0
KVLPVPQK	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Osteoanabolic						1) Repertoire of Structure-Activity-Based Novel Modified Peptides Elicits Enhanced Osteogenic Potential; 2) Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation	1) Reddi, S. et al.; 2) Upadhyay, D. et al.	1) Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.; 2) Biologically active peptides in milk proteins can be used as effective dietary supplements for management of bone-associated issues including osteoporosis. A bioactive peptide derived from milk, viz. VLPVPQK/PepC, has been validated previously from our lab for its osteoanabolic action. In this study, we report 14 novel variants of PepC, designed in silico, based on the structure–activity relationship, aiming to enhance its osteogenic effect that holds tremendous therapeutic utility for bone-related injuries. PepC was computationally modified at seven positions of its original sequence, resulting in 14 modified synthetic peptides for functional predictions and in vitro assessment by comparative analysis of modified peptides by PepC for improved ability in osteogenic functional assays (proliferation potential, antioxidant ability, gene and protein expression, cytotoxic effect, bone mineralization) using calvarial osteoblasts. For most peptides with the highest Peptide7 response relative to PepC (p < 0.05), enhanced osteoanabolic response was observed. Further observations on Peptide7 have therefore been investigated in depth (qPCR, immunoblotting, LCMS/MS, and PCA analysis). Peptide7 displayed a rise in the expression of osteogenes (Osterix, Opg, Bmp2, and Runx2, p < 0.05) and protein (Runx2 and Bmp2, p < 0.05). Besides, LCMS/MS findings suggest Peptide7 escapes intestinal peptidases degradation. Experimental evidence supports an improved osteological reaction to newly modified peptides and hence exploitation in the preparation of functional foods or supplements.	1) 10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2; 2) 10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03385	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.	1) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0
KYPVEPF	P02666	YPVEPF	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Opioid						1) β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells; 2) Enzymatic release of neocasomorphin and  β-casomorphin from bovine  β-casein	1) Plaisancie, P. et al.; 2) Jinsmaa, Y.den. et al.	1) We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.; 2) Conditions for the release of β-casomorphin-7 from bovine β-casein by gastrointestinal proteases in vitro were investigated. β-Casomorphin-7 was released only from a genetic variant of β-casein containing a His residue at the 67th position of the peptide chain. Elastase cleaved the peptide bond between Ile66 and His67, releasing the carboxyl terminus of β-casomorphin-7. Pepsin and leucine aminopeptidase were required to release the amino terminus of this peptide. β-Casomorphin-9, -13, and -21 also were isolated, and their opioid activities were measured. In this study, we also isolated a novel opioid peptide neocasomorphin-6 (Tyr-Pro-Val-Glu-Pro-Phe), which was released by action of trypsin or pepsin and chymotrypsin.	1) 10.1016/s0196-9781(99)00088-1; 2) 10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0
LGPVRGPF	P02666	VLGPVRGPFP	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	212-221	ACE-inhibitory		137.0				1) Antihypertensive Effect of Peptides Obtained from Enterococcus faecalis-Fermented Milk in Rats; 2) Identification of novel antihypertensive peptides in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis	1) Miguel, M. et al.; 2) Quiros, A. et al.	1) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	2	9	1.04e-07	8	0	0

Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1021/jf049510t; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 87.5; 3) 88.89	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 9; 2) 7; 3) 10	1) 7.79e-08; 2) 1.55e-06; 3) 1.04e-07	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion.

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 4) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0; 3) 10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 81.82; 3) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	10	1	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 1.30e-07; 2) 3.50e-10; 3) 9.32e-09; 4) 2.43e-07	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	0	0

Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages.

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases.

The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample.

The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 3) 10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 91.67; 2) 100.0; 3) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	12	1	1) 12; 2) 11; 3) 10	1) 6.38e-13; 2) 5.85e-10; 3) 1.65e-11; 4) 4.20e-10	1) 12; 2) 11; 3) 10	0	0

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase). Declined (p < 0.01) mRNA expression of a transcription factor (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor: Nrf-2) involved in redox signalling further established the protective effect of peptide against oxidative stress induced injury; 3) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.1016/0014-5793(96)00207-4; 2) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 3) 10.1007/s10989-018-9708-7	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 91.67; 2) 83.33	1) 3; 2) 2	12	1	1) 11; 2) 10	1) 1.65e-11; 2) 4.20e-10	1) 11; 2) 10	0	0

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	14	1	12	3.45e-12	12	0	0

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 84.21; 3) 81.25	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 4	16	1	1) 16; 2) 14; 3) 13	1) 1.18e-14; 2) 2.83e-13; 3) 1.91e-17	1) 16; 2) 14; 3) 13	0	0

Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.; 2) A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	1) 10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2; 2) 10.1093/jn/131.11.2936	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 83.33	1) 3; 2) 2	16	1	1) 14; 2) 15	1) 4.79e-16; 2) 1.18e-14	1) 14; 2) 15	0	0

Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.; 2) A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	1) 10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2; 2) 10.1093/jn/131.11.2936	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 88.89; 2) 88.24	1) 3; 2) 2	17	1	1) 16; 2) 15	1) 5.21e-16; 2) 2.13e-17	1) 16; 2) 15	0	0

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 89.47; 2) 84.21; 3) 100.0	1) 4; 2) 3; 3) 1	19	1	1) 16; 2) 19; 3) 17	1) 2.27e-17; 2) 9.55e-19; 3) 1.60e-21	1) 16; 2) 19; 3) 17	0	0

"1) Three peptides produced by a Lactobacillus acidophilus DPC6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 12868 and Escherichia coli DPC5063 were characterized. These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 3) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 2) Yak (Bos grunniens) milk casein derived from Qula, a kind of acid curd cheese from northwestern China, was hydrolysed with alcalase. The hydrolysates collected at different hydrolysis times (0 min, 60 min, 120 min, 180 min, 240 min, 300 min, 360 min) were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE), and the one obtained at 240 min hydrolysis showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity. The active hydrolysate was further consecutively separated by ultrafiltration with 10 kDa and then with 6 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes into different parts, and the 6 kDa permeate showed the highest ACE-inhibiting activity. This active fraction was further purified to yield two novel ACE-inhibiting peptides, whose amino acid sequences were Pro–Pro–Glu–Ile–Asn (PPEIN)(κ-CN; f156–160) and Pro–Leu–Pro–Leu–Leu (PLPLL) (β-CN; f136–140), respectively. The molecular weight and IC50 value of the peptides were 550 Da and 566.4 Da, and 0.29 ± 0.01 mg/ml and 0.25 ± 0.01 mg/ml, respectively.	1) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.10.041; 2) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 83.33; 2) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 2	6	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 1.71e-05; 2) 5.00e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0

These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37 °C for 18 or 24 h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.; 2) Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM).

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group.

Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.; 3) The aim of this study was to investigate the multifunctional properties of specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 on the inhibition of enzymes involved in hypertension (ACE), type 2 diabetes (DPP-IV) and thrombosis (thrombin). Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities. Also, in silico analysis was employed for the prediction of sequences after digestion. Results showed that peptide inhibitory activities on ACE, DPP-IV and thrombin were enhanced after digestion. After in vitro digestion, peptide NAVPITPTLN showed the best efficiency to inhibit DPP-IV. Likewise, NAVPITPTLN and QEPVLGPVRGPFIIV showed high thrombin inhibitory activities, and HPHPHLSFMAIPP and SLPQNIPPL presented high ACE inhibitory activities. In vitro and in silico studies indicated that these peptides are precursors of multifunctional peptide sequences. Therefore, this study suggests that the specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 offer potential beneficial health effects in the management of hypertension, thrombosis and diabetes.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002; 2) 10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112581; 3) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 88.89	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 7	1) 7.79e-08; 2) 1.55e-06	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) The aim of this study was to investigate the multifunctional properties of specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 on the inhibition of enzymes involved in hypertension (ACE), type 2 diabetes (DPP-IV) and thrombosis (thrombin). Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities.

As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.; 2) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified from milk fermented using Lactobacillus delbrueckii QS306. The peptide with the highest angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity (C5) was purified using ultrafiltration with 10 and 3 kDa molecular mass cut-off membranes, Sephadex G-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) gel filtration chromatography, reversed-phase HPLC, and Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We obtained peptide LPYPY by microbial fermentation, which was derived from κ-casein f (AA 77–81). We synthesized LPYPY using an Fmoc solid-phase synthesis method and explored the secondary structure of the pentapeptide. The half maximal inhibitory concentration for the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of LPYPY was 12.87 μg/mL. The results provide additional information for ongoing research and the development of functional foods having antihypertensive effects.	1) 10.3168/jds.2018-15901; 2) 10.1002/elps.200700324	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	5	1	5	5.00e-04	5	0	0

These peptides are known to act as preferred dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) substrates. Five casein-derived synthetic peptides (Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr and Ile-Pro-Ile) and a casein (CasH), whey (WPH) and lactoferrin hydrolysate (LFH) generated with gastrointestinal enzymes were incubated with DPP-IV at 37 °C for 18 or 24 h. Peptide breakdown was evident following incubation with DPP-IV. Different modes of DPP-IV inhibition were observed depending on the test compound. Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr, Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr and Leu-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Tyr were substrate-, Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro-Leu and CasH were prodrug- while WPH and LFH were true DPP-IV inhibitors. These results are relevant for the bioactivity and bioavailability of functional foods targeting DPP-IV inhibition with potential blood glucose regulatory properties in humans.; 2) In recent years, peptides derived from a variety of dietary proteins have been reported to exhibit inhibitory activity against the dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) enzyme, a target in the management of type 2 diabetes. While much attention has been given to the production and identification of peptides with DPP-IV inhibitory activity from food proteins, particularly dairy proteins, little is known on the bioavailability of these molecules. In this study, the stability and transport of five previously identified milk-derived peptides (LKPTPEGDL, LPYPY, IPIQY, IPI and WR) and a whey protein isolate (WPI) digest with DPP-IV-inhibitory activity were investigated using Caco-2 cell monolayers as a model system for human intestinal absorption. Even though a small percentage (ranging from 0.05% for LPYPY to 0.47% for WR) of the bioactive peptides added to the apical side was able to cross the monolayer intact, all five peptides investigated were susceptible to peptidase action during the transport study. Conversely, only minor changes to the WPI digest composition were observed. Determination of the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of the peptides and amino acids identified in the apical and basolateral solutions showed that most degradation products were less effective at inhibiting DPP-IV than the peptide they originated from. Findings from this research suggest that the susceptibility of food-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides to degradation by intestinal brush border membrane enzymes may alter their biological activity in vivo. Further research should be conducted to enhance the bioavailability of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides.	1) 10.1039/c6fo01411a; 2) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.097	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	5	1	5	5.00e-04	5	0	0

In this study, the protein-derived peptide Cp1 was synthesized from bovine αS1-casein, and its potential use as a food biopreservative was indicated by the higher cell selectivity shown by 11-residue peptide towards bacterial cells than human RBCs. It also showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64–640 μM against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The peptide had low hemolytic activity (23.54%, 512 μM) as well as cytotoxicity. The results of fluorescence spectroscopy, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy experiments indicated that Cp1 exerted its activity by permeabilizing the microbial membrane and destroying cell membrane integrity. We found that Cp1 had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, low hemolytic activity, and cytotoxicity. The results also revealed that Cp1 could cause cell death by permeabilizing the cell membrane and disrupting membrane integrity. Overall, the findings presented in this study improve our understanding of the antimicrobial potency of Cp1 and provided evidence of the antimicrobial mechanisms of Cp1. The peptide Cp1 could have potential applications as a food biopreservative.; 2) Bovine casein was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including pepsin, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin and β-chymotrypsin, and assessed for antibacterial activity. The pepsin digest of bovine casein, which showed antibacterial activity, was fractionated using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and the antibacterial peptides isolated were characterised using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. Two antibacterial peptides were identified, a novel peptide (Cp1) which corresponded to residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein and a previously reported peptide (Cp2) which corresponded to residues 183–207 of bovine αS2-casein. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cp1 and Cp2 were determined against a range of bacterial cultures. Cp1 exhibited an MIC of 125 μg mL−1 against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, and MIC ranging between 125 and >1000 μg mL−1 against the Gram-negative bacteria tested. Cp2 was generally far more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria, exhibiting an MIC of 21 μg mL−1, compared to MICs ranging from 332 to >664 μg mL−1 against most of the Gram-negative bacteria tested.; 3) A Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane affinity screening method was developed to separate targeted antimicrobial peptides from the pepsin hydrolyzate of bovine casein. S. cerevisiae cell membranes were first immobilized on the surface of the silica gel to construct an affinity binding medium. A membrane-binding fraction was successfully screened by comparing the RP-HPLC fingerprint chromatograms of the hydrolyzate before and after adsorption with the adsorption medium. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was identified as LRLKKYKVPQL with the use of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer. The sequence corresponded to amino acid residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein. The results indicated that it is feasible to target screen antimicrobial peptides from protein hydrolyzate using S. cerevisiae cell membranes. The influences of thermal treatment, pH, ions, and enzymes on the activity of the purified peptide were also determined. The activity of the peptide was relatively thermally stable and was pH dependent. It retained more than 90% of its activity in the presence of 15% Na+, K+ and pepsin. Trypsin, proteinase K, divalent cation Mg2+ and Ca2+ reduced the activity to different extents. The peptide also showed antibacterial effectiveness in fresh pear juice. These observations provide further information on the application of protein-derived antimicrobial peptides in food systems.	1) 10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.09.030; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.05.005; 3) 10.3390/molecules23051220	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	1	10	1	10	2.61e-10	10	0	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 100.0; 3) 88.89	1	8	1	8	1) 7.79e-08; 2) 5.62e-08; 3) 1.04e-07	8	0	0

Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0; 3) 100.0; 4) 88.89	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 9	1	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 1.63e-07; 2) 8.77e-08; 3) 3.24e-09; 4) 4.50e-09	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

Recently, some physiological significance of peptide fragments derived from milk proteins has been suggested. 1) It has recently been reported that synthetic peptide inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) possibly act as anti-amnestic agents. 2 ) In our previous paper,3) we described the synthesis of a number of peptide fragments of human β-casein, and found that PEP activity was inhibited by the synthetic pep tides within amino acid redidues 49-59 (Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro-Tyr) of β-casein, and the most potent inhibitor was Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-GluPro-Ile (50-57, IC50 = 8 11M)	10.1271/bbb.56.976	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	2	9	1	8	1) 8.77e-08; 2) 1.22e-07	8	0	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus.

LVYPFPGPIHN	P02666	VYPFPGPIPN	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	74-83	Antioxidant		6.2				1) Bioactive peptides generated in an enzyme membrane reactor using Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase; 2) Identification of New Peptides from Fermented Milk Showing Antioxidant Properties: Mechanism of Action	1) Tonolo, F. et al.; 2) Eisele, T. et al.	1) Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 2) 10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	2	11	1	10	7.29e-08	10	1	0

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 2) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 81.25; 2) 86.67	1	14	1	14	1) 9.54e-13; 2) 7.36e-13	14	1	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 89.47; 2) 94.74	1) 1; 2) 2	19	1	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 9.21e-18; 2) 3.83e-19	1) 19; 2) 18	1	0

In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 80.95	1) 1; 2) 2	19	1	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 7.51e-19; 2) 1.72e-17	1) 19; 2) 18	1	0

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 5) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 6) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 7) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 6) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 7) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0; 3) 100.0; 4) 81.82	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 6.62e-08; 2) 1.88e-10; 3) 1.81e-07; 4) 6.94e-09; 5) 5.00e-09; 6) 1.30e-07	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 1; 2) 0	0

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 3) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 5) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 6) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 7) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 6) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 7) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 81.82; 2) 90.91	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 11; 2) 9; 3) 10	1	1) 10; 2) 9; 3) 11	1) 2.87e-10; 2) 7.37e-09; 3) 2.87e-09	1) 10; 2) 9; 3) 11	1) 1; 2) 0	0

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 3) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 3) 10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 81.82; 2) 90.91	1) 3; 2) 2	11	1	1) 9; 2) 10	1) 2.87e-10; 2) 7.37e-09	1) 9; 2) 10	0	0

The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 3) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.; 4) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 2) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 3) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5; 4) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 12; 2) 11; 3) 10	1	1) 10; 2) 12; 3) 11	1) 4.14e-09; 2) 4.20e-10; 3) 1.57e-12	1) 10; 2) 12; 3) 11	1) 1; 2) 0	0

One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.; 4) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 5) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 83.33; 2) 84.21; 3) 100.0; 4) 93.75	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 16; 2) 15	1	1) 16; 2) 15	1) 7.65e-18; 2) 4.79e-16; 3) 1.92e-16; 4) 1.91e-17	1) 16; 2) 15	0	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.; 2) In this study, the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory (ACE-I) activity of peptide fractions from different yoghurt batches was assessed. Inhibition of ACE activity resulted in an overall antihypertensive effect. Yoghurts were prepared either using a sole yoghurt culture including Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus Lb1466 and Streptococcus thermophilus St1342, or L. acidophilus L10, L. casei L26 and Bifidobacterium lactis B94 in addition to yoghurt culture. ACE-I activity was determined at weekly intervals during 28 days of cold storage. Peptide fractions showing high ACE-I activity were further purified using multiple-steps of RP-HPLC. All probiotic yoghurts showed appreciable ACE-I activity during initial stages of storage compared with the control yoghurt, with a significant (p<0.05) decrease afterwards. The ACE-I activity ranged from IC50 of 103.30–27.79 μg mL−1 with the greatest ACE inhibition achieved during first and third week of storage. The in vitro ACE-I activity could be related to the peptide liberation via degradation of caseins. In total, 8 ACE-I peptides were characterized originating from αs2-casein (1), κ-casein (2) and β-casein, of which two well-known ACE-inhibiting peptides, namely Val–Pro–Pro (VPP) and Ile–Pro–Pro (IPP), were identified. These peptides are already used in commercial products.	1) 10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.02.009	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 2) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 4) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 3) 10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 91.67; 2) 90.91; 3) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 2	11	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 10; 2) 12; 3) 11	1) 1.52e-11; 2) 2.87e-10; 3) 3.98e-10; 4) 1.09e-11	1) 11; 2) 10	0	0

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase). Declined (p < 0.01) mRNA expression of a transcription factor (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor: Nrf-2) involved in redox signalling further established the protective effect of peptide against oxidative stress induced injury; 3) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).

In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 2) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 3) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins.

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	2	13	1	12	2.37e-12	12	0	0

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 80.0; 3) 81.25	1) 4; 2) 3; 3) 2	15	1	1) 14; 2) 12; 3) 13	1) 1.96e-12; 2) 2.01e-13; 3) 8.13e-15	1) 14; 2) 12; 3) 13	0	0

Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.; 2) A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells.

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 88.24; 2) 87.5; 3) 84.21	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	16	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 14; 2) 15; 3) 17	1) 8.90e-15; 2) 3.61e-16; 3) 1.91e-17	1) 14; 2) 15; 3) 16	0	0

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 88.24; 2) 93.75	2	16	1	15	1) 3.61e-16; 2) 1.92e-16	15	0	0

Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.; 2) A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	1) 10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2; 2) 10.1093/jn/131.11.2936	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 88.89; 2) 88.24	1) 1; 2) 2	16	1	1) 16; 2) 15	1) 1.44e-17; 2) 3.61e-16	1) 16; 2) 15	0	0

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.0; 2) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 2	10	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 9; 2) 11	1) 3.50e-10; 2) 6.94e-09	1) 9; 2) 10	0	0

Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 91.67; 2) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 2	11	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 12; 2) 10	1) 2.30e-11; 2) 4.20e-10	1) 11; 2) 10	0	0

MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.; 2) The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.; 3) Physiological digestion plays a key role in the formation and degradation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a simulated gastrointestinal digestion on the stability of eight peptides previously identified in fermented milk with antihypertensive activity. Two of these identified peptides with sequences LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, possess ACE-inhibitory activity in vitro and antihypertensive activity in vivo. The results showed that LHLPLP was resistant to digestive enzymes. In contrast, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP was totally hydrolyzed and its activity decreased after incubation with pepsin and a pancreatic extract. The peptide LHLPLP was incubated with ACE and was found to be a true inhibitor of the enzyme and to exhibit a competitive inhibitor pattern. A structure-activity relationship study of this peptide was carried out by synthesizing several modified peptides related to the sequence LHLPLP. The substitution of amino acid Leu in the penultimate position by Gly improved the ACE-inhibitory activity twofold and the substitution of Pro at C-terminal position by Arg increased the activity twofold, with an IC50 of LHLPLR as low as 1.8 microM.; 4) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 5) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.098; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621; 4) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 5) 10.1016/j.peptides.2009.06.031	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 87.5; 3) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 2	7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 6; 3) 7	1) 1.36e-06; 2) 9.79e-07; 3) 3.85e-05; 4) 2.77e-05	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.0; 2) 100.0; 3) 81.82	1	9	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 10; 2) 9; 3) 11	1) 3.24e-09; 2) 4.50e-09; 3) 6.03e-09	9	0	0

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) The aim of this study was to investigate the multifunctional properties of specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 on the inhibition of enzymes involved in hypertension (ACE), type 2 diabetes (DPP-IV) and thrombosis (thrombin). Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities. Also, in silico analysis was employed for the prediction of sequences after digestion. Results showed that peptide inhibitory activities on ACE, DPP-IV and thrombin were enhanced after digestion. After in vitro digestion, peptide NAVPITPTLN showed the best efficiency to inhibit DPP-IV. Likewise, NAVPITPTLN and QEPVLGPVRGPFIIV showed high thrombin inhibitory activities, and HPHPHLSFMAIPP and SLPQNIPPL presented high ACE inhibitory activities. In vitro and in silico studies indicated that these peptides are precursors of multifunctional peptide sequences. Therefore, this study suggests that the specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 offer potential beneficial health effects in the management of hypertension, thrombosis and diabetes.	1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112581; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0	1) 3; 2) 2	10	1	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 1.81e-07; 2) 5.00e-09	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) The aim of this study was to investigate the multifunctional properties of specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 on the inhibition of enzymes involved in hypertension (ACE), type 2 diabetes (DPP-IV) and thrombosis (thrombin). Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities. Also, in silico analysis was employed for the prediction of sequences after digestion. Results showed that peptide inhibitory activities on ACE, DPP-IV and thrombin were enhanced after digestion. After in vitro digestion, peptide NAVPITPTLN showed the best efficiency to inhibit DPP-IV. Likewise, NAVPITPTLN and QEPVLGPVRGPFIIV showed high thrombin inhibitory activities, and HPHPHLSFMAIPP and SLPQNIPPL presented high ACE inhibitory activities. In vitro and in silico studies indicated that these peptides are precursors of multifunctional peptide sequences. Therefore, this study suggests that the specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 offer potential beneficial health effects in the management of hypertension, thrombosis and diabetes.	1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112581; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1) 3; 2) 2	1) 11; 2) 10	1	9	7.37e-09	9	0	0

"1) The fragment-peptides of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI12, CEI5 and CEIβ7) derived from an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein were synthesized. Val-Ala-Pro, the C-terminal tripeptide of CEI5 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro), exhibited more potent inhibitory activity (I50 = 2.0μm) than CEI5 (I50 = 6.0μm). However, d-Val-Ala-Pro showed lower inhibitory activity (I50 = 550μm). Val-Ala-Pro may be important for the inhibitory activity of CEI5. The C-terminal heptapeptide of CEI12 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys) and the short fragments of CEIβ7 (Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg) showed lower inhibitory activities than the full-length peptides.

Also, the antihypertensive activity of CEI12 and CEI5 was investigated. CEI12, intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 14.2 mg/kg, antagonized the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I.; 2) An 8-AA (8mer) fragment (PFPEVFGK) of a known antihypertensive peptide derived from bovine αS1-casein (C12 antihypertensive peptide) was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods."	1) 10.1080/00021369.1987.10868244; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-10437	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 2	8	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 5.62e-08; 2) 1.55e-06	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.02.011; 2) 10.3390/foods9080991	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.85e-05	6	0	0

The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) β-Casomorphin-7 (β-CM-7) is a milk biological active peptide. The present study is aimed to investigate the protective effects of β-CM-7, against oxidative stress in pancreas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by assaying malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) level, the activity of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and NF-κB, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. A significant increase in the level of oxidative stress was observed in pancreas of the diabetic rats when compared to control rats. After 15 d oral administration of β-CM-7 (7.5 × 10−8mol/d), the pancreas MDA level was markedly reduced. Oral administration of β-CM-7 to diabetic rats showed an obviously increase in the activity of catalase in pancreas, oral administration of β-CM-7 to the diabetic group of rats also showed a reduction of NF-κB and iNOS gene expression in pancreas. The elevated pancreas NO level was markedly reduced by the oral administration of β-CM-7. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that β-CM-7 may cause protective effects such as pronounced decreasing in oxidative stress and inhibiting NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal pathway in pancreas of diabetes rats.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02577.x	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.85e-05	6	0	0
PFPGPIH	P02666	YPFPGPI	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-81	Increase mucin secretion	1) Increase MUC expression; 2) prevents naloxone mucus inhibition					1) β-Casomorphin-7 regulates the secretion and expression of gastrointestinal mucins through a u-opioid pathway; 2) Effects of peptides derived from dietary proteins on mucus secretion in rat jejunum; 3) Milk Bioactive Peptides and -Casomorphins Induce Mucus Release in Rat Jejunum	1) Claustre, J. et al.; 2) Trompette, A. et al.; 3) Zoghbi, S. et al.	1) The hypothesis that dietary proteins or their hydrolysates may regulate intestinal mucin discharge was investigated in the isolated vascularly perfused rat jejunum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat intestinal mucins. On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls). Lactalbumin hydrolysate (5%) also evoked mucin discharge. In contrast, casein, and a mixture of amino acids was without effect. Chicken egg albumin and its hydrolysate or meat hydrolysate also did not modify mucin release. Interestingly, casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion was abolished by intra-arterial TTX or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). β-Casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide released from β-casein on milk ingestion, induced a strong mucin secretion (response at 563% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone. Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 2) We have recently shown that β-casomorphin-7, a milk opioid peptide, strongly stimulates mucin secretion in the rat jejunum through a nervous pathway and opioid receptor activation. In this study, the hypothesis that β-casomorphin-7 may also act directly on intestinal goblet cells was investigated in vitro in rat and human intestinal mucin-producing cells (DHE and HT29-MTX) using quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. The presence of μ-opioid receptors was demonstrated in rat goblet cells in the upper half of the colonic crypt and in the two cell lines by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In rat DHE cells, β-casomorphin-7 increased the expression of rat mucin (rMuc)2 and rMuc3 but not rMuc1, rMuc4, and rMuc5AC. This effect was time and dose dependent, with the maximum of increase in transcripts being noticed for a concentration of 10−4 M after 2 h of stimulation for rMuc2 (225% of controls) and 4 h of stimulation for rMuc3 (208% of controls). Mucin secretion was maximally increased after 8 h of stimulation. Interestingly, these effects were prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the μ-opioid antagonist cyprodime. In human HT29-MTX cells, β-casomorphin-7 (10−4 M) also increased MUC5AC mRNA levels (219% after 24 h of stimulation) and the secretion of this mucin (169% of controls). In conclusion, β-casomorphin-7 may contribute significantly to mucin production via a direct effect on intestinal goblet cells and the activation of μ-opioid receptors. Because intestinal mucins have a crucial mucosal protective function, dairy products containing β-casomorphin-7 may improve intestinal protection and could have dietary and health applications.; 3) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1152/ajpgi.00455.2005; 2) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.85e-05	6	0	0

Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.; 2) The hypothesis that dietary proteins or their hydrolysates may regulate intestinal mucin discharge was investigated in the isolated vascularly perfused rat jejunum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat intestinal mucins. On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls).

Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 3) Two opioid peptides with agonistic (β-casomorphin-5 and β-casomorphin-7) and three with antagonistic (casoxin-6, casoxin-C and lactoferroxin A) activity were determined in three semi-hard cheeses (Edamski, Gouda and Kasztelan) and in two ripening mould cheeses (Brie and Rokpol). β-Casomorphins (BCMs) were found at a higher level in the mould cheeses, whereas the opioid peptides with antagonistic activity were identified at a higher level in the semi-hard cheeses. The opioid activities of the peptide extracts from the cheeses were confirmed using isolated rabbit ileum.; 4) Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.; 5) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum.

Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.10.011; 2) 10.1007/BF02019390; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499; 4) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 5) 10.1021/jf301279k	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.85e-05	6	0	0

Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 3) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 4) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 2) 10.3390/foods9080991; 3) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 4) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 87.5; 3) 100.0; 4) 88.89	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 2.16e-06; 2) 7.79e-08; 3) 5.62e-08; 4) 1.04e-07	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 3) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 88.89	1) 1; 2) 2	8	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 9; 2) 7	1) 7.79e-08; 2) 1.55e-06	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 2) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 81.25	1	1) 12; 2) 13	4	1) 16; 2) 15	1) 9.24e-14; 2) 2.37e-12	1) 12; 2) 13	0	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 84.21; 2) 88.89	1	16	1) 4; 2) 3	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 3.06e-17; 2) 4.07e-17	16	0	0

In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased. The peptides not hydrolysed by gastrointestinal enzymes and peptide VRYL, which was only partly hydrolysed, were incubated with ACE and were found to be true inhibitors of the enzyme and to have a competitive inhibition pattern.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.04.007	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 83.33	1	1) 6; 2) 5	2	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 2.37e-05; 2) 6.95e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0
PVLGPVRGP	P02666	VLGPVRGPFP	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	212-221	ACE-inhibitory		137.0				1) Antihypertensive Effect of Peptides Obtained from Enterococcus faecalis-Fermented Milk in Rats; 2) Identification of novel antihypertensive peptides in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis	1) Miguel, M. et al.; 2) Quiros, A. et al.	1) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	2	9	1	8	1.63e-07	8	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.0; 2) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 2	10	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 9; 2) 11	1) 3.50e-10; 2) 6.94e-09	1) 9; 2) 10	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins.

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	4	15	1.57e-12	12	0	0

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 87.5	1	14	1) 4; 2) 3	1) 16; 2) 17	1) 4.13e-15; 2) 5.46e-15	14	0	0

From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 80.0	1	1) 14; 2) 12	4	1) 15; 2) 17	1) 3.45e-12; 2) 5.46e-15	1) 14; 2) 12	0	0
PVRGPFPIIV	P02666	VRGPFPIIV	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	216-224	ACE-inhibitory		600.0				1) Antihypertensive Effect of Peptides Obtained from Enterococcus faecalis-Fermented Milk in Rats; 2) Identification of novel antihypertensive peptides in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis	1) Miguel, M. et al.; 2) Quiros, A. et al.	1) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	2	10	1	9	5.00e-09	9	0	0

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 2) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 3) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 3) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.0; 2) 81.82	1	9	1) 3; 2) 2	1) 10; 2) 11	1) 6.03e-09; 2) 4.50e-09	9	0	0

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase). Declined (p < 0.01) mRNA expression of a transcription factor (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor: Nrf-2) involved in redox signalling further established the protective effect of peptide against oxidative stress induced injury; 3) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.1016/0014-5793(96)00207-4; 2) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 3) 10.1007/s10989-018-9708-7	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1	9	1) 3; 2) 2	1) 10; 2) 11	1) 1.38e-08; 2) 1.02e-08	9	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 91.67; 2) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 12; 2) 10	1) 1; 2) 2	11	1) 2.30e-11; 2) 5.85e-10	1) 11; 2) 10	0	0

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	2	13	1.57e-12	12	0	0

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 92.31; 2) 81.25	1) 1; 2) 2	13	1	1) 12; 2) 13	1) 9.59e-13; 2) 9.24e-14	1) 12; 2) 13	0	0

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 85.71; 3) 87.5	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 14; 2) 13	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 14; 2) 12; 3) 15	1) 1.39e-12; 2) 4.13e-15; 3) 5.46e-15	1) 14; 2) 12	0	0

Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 2) This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 3) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 88.24; 3) 93.75	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 15; 2) 13	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 16; 2) 12; 3) 15	1) 2.44e-16; 2) 1.96e-12; 3) 1.80e-16	1) 12; 2) 15	0	0

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 88.24; 2) 93.33	1	1) 14; 2) 15	2	1) 16; 2) 15	1) 2.44e-16; 2) 4.54e-15	1) 14; 2) 15	0	0

Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.; 2) A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	1) 10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2; 2) 10.1093/jn/131.11.2936	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 83.33; 2) 88.24	1	15	1) 3; 2) 2	1) 16; 2) 17	1) 2.44e-16; 2) 3.23e-16	15	0	0

Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry.

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	2.37e-05	6	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5. These results provide novel insight into the mineral transport activity of phosphopeptides obtained from casein.	10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05711	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.0; 2) 83.33	1	1) 15; 2) 18	2	1) 16; 2) 19	1) 5.08e-20; 2) 5.39e-16	1) 15; 2) 18	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity.

Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.; 2) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.; 3) Milk and milk-derived products are a relevant source of bioactive peptides, which are also potential components of functional foods. Bioactive peptides exert multiple actions including an antioxidant role. In the present paper, four synthetic peptides (NPYVPR, AVPYPQR, KVLPVPEK, and ARHPHPHLSFM), corresponding to milk-derived peptides were studied. Although with different features, as revealed by RP-HPLC chromatography and MS analysis, the obtained peptides were shown to be taken up by Caco-2 cells arranged in an epithelial monolayer formation. The four peptides were all able to preserve cell viability against induced oxidative stress indicating that they might have a role in the control of oxidative stress. Therefore, an estimation of total thiols and glutathione content was performed after cell treatment with oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TbOOH). The peptides were able to prevent the decrease of both total thiols and glutathione induced by H2O2 or TbOOH, and, in addition, they showed a protective effect on the thiol-related antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase. Finally, they caused a decrease of ROS production induced by TbOOH in Caco-2 cells. The reported results highlight the relevant antioxidant role played by bioactive peptides in cells, which adds to other previously known properties.	1) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696; 2) 10.1039/c7fo01646h; 3) 10.1021/jf0003911	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0

The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography.

One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.; 4) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 5) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	82.61	3	21	1	19	6.40e-21	19	0	0

From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm.

In this study, the protein-derived peptide Cp1 was synthesized from bovine αS1-casein, and its potential use as a food biopreservative was indicated by the higher cell selectivity shown by 11-residue peptide towards bacterial cells than human RBCs. It also showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64–640 μM against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The peptide had low hemolytic activity (23.54%, 512 μM) as well as cytotoxicity. The results of fluorescence spectroscopy, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy experiments indicated that Cp1 exerted its activity by permeabilizing the microbial membrane and destroying cell membrane integrity. We found that Cp1 had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, low hemolytic activity, and cytotoxicity. The results also revealed that Cp1 could cause cell death by permeabilizing the cell membrane and disrupting membrane integrity. Overall, the findings presented in this study improve our understanding of the antimicrobial potency of Cp1 and provided evidence of the antimicrobial mechanisms of Cp1. The peptide Cp1 could have potential applications as a food biopreservative.; 2) Bovine casein was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including pepsin, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin and β-chymotrypsin, and assessed for antibacterial activity. The pepsin digest of bovine casein, which showed antibacterial activity, was fractionated using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and the antibacterial peptides isolated were characterised using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. Two antibacterial peptides were identified, a novel peptide (Cp1) which corresponded to residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein and a previously reported peptide (Cp2) which corresponded to residues 183–207 of bovine αS2-casein. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cp1 and Cp2 were determined against a range of bacterial cultures. Cp1 exhibited an MIC of 125 μg mL−1 against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, and MIC ranging between 125 and >1000 μg mL−1 against the Gram-negative bacteria tested. Cp2 was generally far more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria, exhibiting an MIC of 21 μg mL−1, compared to MICs ranging from 332 to >664 μg mL−1 against most of the Gram-negative bacteria tested.; 3) A Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane affinity screening method was developed to separate targeted antimicrobial peptides from the pepsin hydrolyzate of bovine casein. S. cerevisiae cell membranes were first immobilized on the surface of the silica gel to construct an affinity binding medium. A membrane-binding fraction was successfully screened by comparing the RP-HPLC fingerprint chromatograms of the hydrolyzate before and after adsorption with the adsorption medium. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was identified as LRLKKYKVPQL with the use of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer. The sequence corresponded to amino acid residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein. The results indicated that it is feasible to target screen antimicrobial peptides from protein hydrolyzate using S. cerevisiae cell membranes. The influences of thermal treatment, pH, ions, and enzymes on the activity of the purified peptide were also determined. The activity of the peptide was relatively thermally stable and was pH dependent. It retained more than 90% of its activity in the presence of 15% Na+, K+ and pepsin. Trypsin, proteinase K, divalent cation Mg2+ and Ca2+ reduced the activity to different extents. The peptide also showed antibacterial effectiveness in fresh pear juice. These observations provide further information on the application of protein-derived antimicrobial peptides in food systems.	1) 10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.09.030; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.05.005; 3) 10.3390/molecules23051220	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	1	10	2	11	2.61e-10	10	0	0

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified was casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of αs1-casein. This product consisted of the N-terminal segment (1–23) of αs1-casein B, named ‘isracidin’, and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest, in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source."	1) 10.1016/0278-6915(95)00097-6; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	82.61	1	19	1	19	5.28e-21	19	0	0

"1) Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.; 2) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 3) Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified was casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of αs1-casein. This product consisted of the N-terminal segment (1–23) of αs1-casein B, named ‘isracidin’, and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest, in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source."	1) 10.1016/0278-6915(95)00097-6; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x; 3) 10.1002/mnfr.201500182	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 95.83; 2) 100.0	1	23	1	23	1) 2.82e-26; 2) 2.03e-26	23	0	0

The αs1-casein tryptic hydrolysate containing this peptide decreases stress effects after oral administration in various species including man. Therefore, the stability of this peptide toward gastric and pancreatic proteases has been assessed by using pepsin, chymotrypsin/trypsin, Corolase PP, pepsin followed by chymotrypsin/trypsin or pepsin followed by Corolase PP. α-Casozepine was slowly degraded by chymotrypsin, much more sensitive to pepsin and Corolase PP but not completely destroyed after 4 h kinetics. The bonds in the region 91 to 95 of the α-casozepine were totally resistant to hydrolysis by all studied proteases. Surprisingly, a fragment, corresponding to the sequence 91−97 and found in all the hydrolysis media in significant amount, possessed an anxiolytic activity in three behavioral tests measuring this parameter. This peptide could participate in the in vivo activity of α-casozepine.; 2) α-Casozepine and f91–97, peptides from αs1-casein, display anxiolytic activity in rats and may have to cross the intestinal epithelium to exert this central effect. We evaluated their resistance to hydrolysis by the peptidases of Caco-2 cells and their ability to cross the cell monolayer. To mimic physiological conditions, two preparations of bile salts were used in noncytotoxic concentrations: porcine bile extract and an equimolar mixture of taurocholate, cholate, and deoxycholate. The presence and composition of bile salts appeared to modulate the peptidase activities of the Caco-2 cells involved (i) in the hydrolysis of α-casozepine, leading to much higher formation of fragments f91–99, f91–98, and f91–97, and (ii) in the hydrolysis of f91–97, leading to lower degradation of this peptide. Transport of α-casozepine across Caco-2 monolayer increased significantly, in the presence of bile extract, and of fragment f91–97, in the presence of bile salts.	1) 10.1021/jf104089c; 2) 10.1021/jf202890e	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Casein-derived antioxidant peptides by using microbial proteases have gained increasing attention. Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.	10.4014/jmb.2104.04013	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.91; 2) 83.33	1	10	2	11	1) 3.50e-10; 2) 2.61e-10	10	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5. These results provide novel insight into the mineral transport activity of phosphopeptides obtained from casein.	10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05711	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 85.0	1	1) 14; 2) 17	3	1) 16; 2) 19	1) 1.14e-18; 2) 1.25e-14	1) 14; 2) 17	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins or artificial synthetic products. Further research examining the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods. Our research also demonstrates that ACE inhibitory peptide LAP may lower blood pressure with no adverse effects.; 3) Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.; 4) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 5) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.02.005; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 5) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 87.5; 3) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 2	8	1) 1; 2) 3	1) 8; 2) 7; 3) 10	1) 5.62e-08; 2) 1.55e-06; 3) 1.04e-07	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.; 2) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.; 3) Milk and milk-derived products are a relevant source of bioactive peptides, which are also potential components of functional foods. Bioactive peptides exert multiple actions including an antioxidant role. In the present paper, four synthetic peptides (NPYVPR, AVPYPQR, KVLPVPEK, and ARHPHPHLSFM), corresponding to milk-derived peptides were studied. Although with different features, as revealed by RP-HPLC chromatography and MS analysis, the obtained peptides were shown to be taken up by Caco-2 cells arranged in an epithelial monolayer formation. The four peptides were all able to preserve cell viability against induced oxidative stress indicating that they might have a role in the control of oxidative stress. Therefore, an estimation of total thiols and glutathione content was performed after cell treatment with oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TbOOH). The peptides were able to prevent the decrease of both total thiols and glutathione induced by H2O2 or TbOOH, and, in addition, they showed a protective effect on the thiol-related antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase. Finally, they caused a decrease of ROS production induced by TbOOH in Caco-2 cells. The reported results highlight the relevant antioxidant role played by bioactive peptides in cells, which adds to other previously known properties.	1) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696; 2) 10.1039/c7fo01646h; 3) 10.1021/jf0003911	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	2.16e-06	7	0	0

Therefore, understanding the role of specific food-derived molecules in the regulation of their specific pathways is a relevant issue. Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-α, the levels of NF-κB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-α alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-α) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.; 2) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 2) 10.3390/ijms23084382	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1) 2.16e-06; 2) 1.55e-06	7	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0; 2) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	1) 1; 2) 3	1) 8; 2) 10	1) 1.30e-07; 2) 2.43e-07	8	0	0

Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.; 2) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.; 3) Milk and milk-derived products are a relevant source of bioactive peptides, which are also potential components of functional foods. Bioactive peptides exert multiple actions including an antioxidant role. In the present paper, four synthetic peptides (NPYVPR, AVPYPQR, KVLPVPEK, and ARHPHPHLSFM), corresponding to milk-derived peptides were studied. Although with different features, as revealed by RP-HPLC chromatography and MS analysis, the obtained peptides were shown to be taken up by Caco-2 cells arranged in an epithelial monolayer formation. The four peptides were all able to preserve cell viability against induced oxidative stress indicating that they might have a role in the control of oxidative stress. Therefore, an estimation of total thiols and glutathione content was performed after cell treatment with oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TbOOH). The peptides were able to prevent the decrease of both total thiols and glutathione induced by H2O2 or TbOOH, and, in addition, they showed a protective effect on the thiol-related antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase. Finally, they caused a decrease of ROS production induced by TbOOH in Caco-2 cells. The reported results highlight the relevant antioxidant role played by bioactive peptides in cells, which adds to other previously known properties.	1) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696; 2) 10.1039/c7fo01646h; 3) 10.1021/jf0003911	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	2	9	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) The aim of this study was to investigate the multifunctional properties of specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 on the inhibition of enzymes involved in hypertension (ACE), type 2 diabetes (DPP-IV) and thrombosis (thrombin). Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities. Also, in silico analysis was employed for the prediction of sequences after digestion. Results showed that peptide inhibitory activities on ACE, DPP-IV and thrombin were enhanced after digestion. After in vitro digestion, peptide NAVPITPTLN showed the best efficiency to inhibit DPP-IV. Likewise, NAVPITPTLN and QEPVLGPVRGPFIIV showed high thrombin inhibitory activities, and HPHPHLSFMAIPP and SLPQNIPPL presented high ACE inhibitory activities. In vitro and in silico studies indicated that these peptides are precursors of multifunctional peptide sequences. Therefore, this study suggests that the specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 offer potential beneficial health effects in the management of hypertension, thrombosis and diabetes.	1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112581; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 100.0; 2) 88.89	1) 1; 2) 2	9	1	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 3.24e-09; 2) 1.22e-07	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	2	10	1	9	1) 1.02e-08; 2) 7.37e-09	9	0	0

Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient.

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 2) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 88.24	2	1) 16; 2) 17	1	1) 16; 2) 15	1) 6.34e-14; 2) 2.67e-15	1) 16; 2) 15	1	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 80.95	1) 3; 2) 2	20	1	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 7.51e-19; 2) 1.72e-17	1) 19; 2) 18	1	0

The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 3) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4.

The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis.

The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures.

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

SLVYPFPGPIPN	P02666	VYPFPGPIPN	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	74-83	Antioxidant		6.2				1) Bioactive peptides generated in an enzyme membrane reactor using Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase; 2) Identification of New Peptides from Fermented Milk Showing Antioxidant Properties: Mechanism of Action	1) Tonolo, F. et al.; 2) Eisele, T. et al.	1) Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 2) 10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	3	12	1	10	4.20e-10	10	0	0

The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient.

One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.; 4) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 5) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 84.21; 2) 83.33; 3) 88.24; 4) 94.12	1) 3; 2) 2	1) 16; 2) 17	1	1) 16; 2) 15	1) 2.76e-16; 2) 2.83e-17; 3) 1.13e-17; 4) 6.91e-16	1) 16; 2) 15	0	0

Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 86.36; 2) 81.82	1) 3; 2) 2	20	1	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 4.67e-21; 2) 1.08e-19	1) 19; 2) 18	0	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus.

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0; 2) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 3	10	1	1) 8; 2) 10	1) 1.30e-07; 2) 1.88e-10	1) 8; 2) 10	0	0

"Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182	sequence	IDENTITY	80.77	6	26	1	21	1) 7.71e-23; 2) 1.32e-22; 3) 5.75e-23	21	0	0

DPP-IV inhibitors have emerged as new and promising oral agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of β-lactoglobulin as natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. A whey protein concentrate rich in β-lactoglobulin was hydrolysed with trypsin and fractionated using a chromatographic separation at semipreparative scale. Two of the six collected fractions showed notable DPP-IV inhibitory activity. These fractions were analysed by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to identify peptides responsible for the observed activity. The most potent fragment (IPAVF) corresponded to β-lactoglobulin f(78–82) which IC50 value was 44.7 μM. The results suggest that peptides derived from β-lactoglobulin would be beneficial ingredients of foods against type 2 diabetes.; 2) Whey proteins are rich sources of bioactive peptides which may play a role in the dietary management of chronic diseases. Fractionation via ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the enrichment of antioxidant, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in a tryptic hydrolysate of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg TH). UF processing selectively enhanced the biofunctional properties of β-Lg TH with the permeate obtained using a 1 kDa polyethersulfone (HFP-1) membrane having highest in vitro multifunctional bioactivity. Compared to β-Lg TH, the antioxidant activity was 1.7-fold higher (46,765 ± 2504 vs. 77,251 ± 5124 µmol Trolox equivalent/100 g dw; P < 0.05), DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) decreased threefold (1.6 ± 0.31 vs. 0.53 ± 0.05 mg/mL; P < 0.05) and there was a twofold reduction in ACE IC50 (0.131 ± 0.005 vs. 0.068 ± 0.018 mg/mL; P < 0.05). The multifunctional peptide VAGTWY, β-Lg f(15–20) was shown to have potent antioxidant activity (5.63 µmol TE/µmol peptide). Two new ACE inhibitory peptides, IIAEK and IPAVFK, having IC50 values of 63.7 ± 7.22 and 144.8 ± 25.3 μM, respectively, were also identified in β-Lg TH. This study demonstrates the multifunctional bioactive properties of a β-Lg TH and its associated UF fractions.	1) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.03.056; 2) 10.1016/j.jff.2014.04.002	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	1	11	1	11	2.41e-11	11	0	0

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 2) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	4	18	1	15	1) 5.39e-16; 2) 3.87e-16	15	0	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	84.21	4	19	1	16	1) 2.27e-17; 2) 5.71e-17	16	0	0

An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.; 2) Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.; 3) Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity; 4) Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a peptidyldipeptide hydrolase (EC 3.4.15.1) which cleaves dipeptides from the Jree COOH-terminal of peptides. The enzyme hydrolyzes both angiotensin I and bradykinin, generating the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II fiom angiotensin I, and vasoinactive peptides from the vasodilator bradykinin. Inhibitors of ACE were first obtained from the venom of snakes such as Bothrops jararacal ) and Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii) Later, Oshima et a/. found peptide inhibitors of ACE in digests of gelafin with bacterial collagenase) A characteristic of these inhibitors is that they have a Pro-Pro, Ala-Pro or Ala-Hyp sequence at their COOH-terminal. We have observed that a peptide contained in the tryptic hydrolysate of casein inhibits ACE markedly. In this communication, we want to report the purification and determination of the amino acid sequence of an inhibitor in the tryptic hydrolysate of casein.; 5) An 8-AA (8mer) fragment (PFPEVFGK) of a known antihypertensive peptide derived from bovine αS1-casein (C12 antihypertensive peptide) was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods.	1) 10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-10437; 3) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.098; 4) 10.1021/jf049510t; 5) 10.1080/00021369.1982.10865255	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0; 3) 83.33	1) 1; 2) 3	1) 9; 2) 10	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 8; 2) 12; 3) 10	1) 1.30e-07; 2) 3.50e-10; 3) 6.94e-09	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	0	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively.

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	1	8	1.04e-07	8	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats.

In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	10	1) 1; 2) 3	1) 12; 2) 10	1) 7.88e-10; 2) 4.20e-10	10	0	0

"1) Three peptides produced by a Lactobacillus acidophilus DPC6026 fermentation of sodium caseinate and showing antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains Enterobacter sakazakii ATCC 12868 and Escherichia coli DPC5063 were characterized. These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 3) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.; 2) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins or artificial synthetic products. Further research examining the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods. Our research also demonstrates that ACE inhibitory peptide LAP may lower blood pressure with no adverse effects.; 3) Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.; 4) The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.; 5) An optimal antihypertensive peptide (AHP), KVLPVP, was linked to form a six-copy of tandem dotetracontapeptide with the specific cleavage site (Arg-X) of clostripain. The gene of the dotetracontapeptide was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. After a 5 h induction with 1.2 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside the recombinant AHP fused with glutathione-S-transferase tag reached the maximal production, 24.6% of total intracellular protein. Following digestion with clostripain and carboxypeptidase B, the product was separated with ultrafiltration and reversed-phase HPLC, and 170 mg of pure recombinant AHP was obtained from 1 L of E. coli culture. The IC50 of the recombinant AHP was 4.6 microM. The systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats could be decreased dramatically by the recombinant AHP in a dose-dependent manner after delivering 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of body weight (BW) or 0.6 mg of AHP/kg of BW orally. The strong antihypertensive effect was reached 4-24 h after oral administration of 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of BW, and the peak point was at the fourth hour (-21.4 +/- 7.2 mm of Hg). This study overcame traditional enzymatic digestion problems in preparing AHP and established a novel approach for industrial production of AHP.; 6) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1; 2) 10.1021/jf0703248; 3) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.121; 4) 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.02.005; 5) 10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621; 6) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 83.33	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 0.005; 2) 2.37e-05; 3) 6.95e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 1; 2) 0	0

We scrutinised the antioxidative property of peptides from buffalo casein digested with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin alone and in combinations. Casein hydrolysates were subjected to ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The antioxidant properties of casein, its hydrolysates and synthetic peptides, was assessed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid). The fraction with highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) was selected for further study. TEAC of casein was 0.862 ± 0.11 μmol mg−1, while it is highest for pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates. The 1 kDa permeate of pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates possessed the highest antioxidant activity and it was resolved into 16 fractions by RP-HPLC. Antioxidant activity fraction 11 was highest and on custom sequencing yielded 4 peptides, of which the synthetic peptide VLPVPQK possessed the highest TEAC (5.71 ± 0.59 μmol mg−1).; 2) In the recent time, demand for nontoxic antioxidative substances such as peptides has boomed among pharmacologists. In the present investigation, peptides, VLPVPQ and VLPVP were generated from parent antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. Initially, all these peptides were studied in-silico for biophysical properties like hydrophobicity, structure, Extinction coefficient, isoelectric point, grand average hydropathy value and Wimley White whole residue hydrophobicity. Inspite of this, homology relationship among organisms, taxonomy, digestibility assessment for proteases, solubility, melting temperature index, half-life time in-vitro and in-vivo, instability index and aliphatic index was compared in-silico. Further, based on these properties, VLPVP was compared with parent peptide, VLPVPQK for antioxidative potential. VLPVP exhibited lesser antioxidative potential by chemical method and in-vitro hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress conditions generated in fibroblast cells compared to VLPVPQK. The proliferative potential, cell injury marker, nitric oxide production and pro-inflammatory, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α was measured to compare cytoprotective antioxidative potential. The results displayed the cytoprotective potential of VLPVPQK. In addition, the present study suggested that glutamine and lysine are responsible for the c-terminal sequence based response and cytoprotective potential of milk bioactive peptide, VLPVPQK. Other than this, hydrophobic amino acids and positive charge of the VLPVPQK is also responsible for the cytoprotective potential.	1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2019.108816; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2014.11.001	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0
VLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Osteoanabolic						1) Repertoire of Structure-Activity-Based Novel Modified Peptides Elicits Enhanced Osteogenic Potential; 2) Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation	1) Reddi, S. et al.; 2) Upadhyay, D. et al.	1) Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.; 2) Biologically active peptides in milk proteins can be used as effective dietary supplements for management of bone-associated issues including osteoporosis. A bioactive peptide derived from milk, viz. VLPVPQK/PepC, has been validated previously from our lab for its osteoanabolic action. In this study, we report 14 novel variants of PepC, designed in silico, based on the structure–activity relationship, aiming to enhance its osteogenic effect that holds tremendous therapeutic utility for bone-related injuries. PepC was computationally modified at seven positions of its original sequence, resulting in 14 modified synthetic peptides for functional predictions and in vitro assessment by comparative analysis of modified peptides by PepC for improved ability in osteogenic functional assays (proliferation potential, antioxidant ability, gene and protein expression, cytotoxic effect, bone mineralization) using calvarial osteoblasts. For most peptides with the highest Peptide7 response relative to PepC (p < 0.05), enhanced osteoanabolic response was observed. Further observations on Peptide7 have therefore been investigated in depth (qPCR, immunoblotting, LCMS/MS, and PCA analysis). Peptide7 displayed a rise in the expression of osteogenes (Osterix, Opg, Bmp2, and Runx2, p < 0.05) and protein (Runx2 and Bmp2, p < 0.05). Besides, LCMS/MS findings suggest Peptide7 escapes intestinal peptidases degradation. Experimental evidence supports an improved osteological reaction to newly modified peptides and hence exploitation in the preparation of functional foods or supplements.	1) 10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2; 2) 10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03385	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0

We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.02.005; 3) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 4) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.121	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 100.0	1	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 1; 2) 2	7	1) 9.79e-07; 2) 3.85e-05	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0

In the present investigation, peptides, VLPVPQ and VLPVP were generated from parent antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. Initially, all these peptides were studied in-silico for biophysical properties like hydrophobicity, structure, Extinction coefficient, isoelectric point, grand average hydropathy value and Wimley White whole residue hydrophobicity. Inspite of this, homology relationship among organisms, taxonomy, digestibility assessment for proteases, solubility, melting temperature index, half-life time in-vitro and in-vivo, instability index and aliphatic index was compared in-silico. Further, based on these properties, VLPVP was compared with parent peptide, VLPVPQK for antioxidative potential. VLPVP exhibited lesser antioxidative potential by chemical method and in-vitro hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress conditions generated in fibroblast cells compared to VLPVPQK. The proliferative potential, cell injury marker, nitric oxide production and pro-inflammatory, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α was measured to compare cytoprotective antioxidative potential. The results displayed the cytoprotective potential of VLPVPQK. In addition, the present study suggested that glutamine and lysine are responsible for the c-terminal sequence based response and cytoprotective potential of milk bioactive peptide, VLPVPQK. Other than this, hydrophobic amino acids and positive charge of the VLPVPQK is also responsible for the cytoprotective potential.; 2) Bioactive peptides have been defined as specific protein fragments that have a positive impact on body functions or conditions and may ultimately influence health. We scrutinised the antioxidative property of peptides from buffalo casein digested with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin alone and in combinations. Casein hydrolysates were subjected to ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The antioxidant properties of casein, its hydrolysates and synthetic peptides, was assessed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid). The fraction with highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) was selected for further study. TEAC of casein was 0.862 ± 0.11 μmol mg−1, while it is highest for pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates. The 1 kDa permeate of pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates possessed the highest antioxidant activity and it was resolved into 16 fractions by RP-HPLC. Antioxidant activity fraction 11 was highest and on custom sequencing yielded 4 peptides, of which the synthetic peptide VLPVPQK possessed the highest TEAC (5.71 ± 0.59 μmol mg−1).; 3) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.; 4) The antioxidant activity of caseins and casein-derived peptides was evaluated by using three free radical producing reactionsthe lipoxygenase- and AAPH-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.; 5) Milk and milk-derived products are a relevant source of bioactive peptides, which are also potential components of functional foods. Bioactive peptides exert multiple actions including an antioxidant role. In the present paper, four synthetic peptides (NPYVPR, AVPYPQR, KVLPVPEK, and ARHPHPHLSFM), corresponding to milk-derived peptides were studied. Although with different features, as revealed by RP-HPLC chromatography and MS analysis, the obtained peptides were shown to be taken up by Caco-2 cells arranged in an epithelial monolayer formation. The four peptides were all able to preserve cell viability against induced oxidative stress indicating that they might have a role in the control of oxidative stress. Therefore, an estimation of total thiols and glutathione content was performed after cell treatment with oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TbOOH). The peptides were able to prevent the decrease of both total thiols and glutathione induced by H2O2 or TbOOH, and, in addition, they showed a protective effect on the thiol-related antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase. Finally, they caused a decrease of ROS production induced by TbOOH in Caco-2 cells. The reported results highlight the relevant antioxidant role played by bioactive peptides in cells, which adds to other previously known properties.	1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2019.108816; 2) 10.1021/jf0003911; 3) 10.1039/c7fo01646h; 4) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2014.11.001	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 100.0	1	7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 9.79e-07; 2) 1.36e-06	7	0	0

Therefore, understanding the role of specific food-derived molecules in the regulation of their specific pathways is a relevant issue. Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-α, the levels of NF-κB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-α alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-α) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.; 2) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins.

Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation.

Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.; 2) Biologically active peptides in milk proteins can be used as effective dietary supplements for management of bone-associated issues including osteoporosis. A bioactive peptide derived from milk, viz. VLPVPQK/PepC, has been validated previously from our lab for its osteoanabolic action. In this study, we report 14 novel variants of PepC, designed in silico, based on the structure–activity relationship, aiming to enhance its osteogenic effect that holds tremendous therapeutic utility for bone-related injuries. PepC was computationally modified at seven positions of its original sequence, resulting in 14 modified synthetic peptides for functional predictions and in vitro assessment by comparative analysis of modified peptides by PepC for improved ability in osteogenic functional assays (proliferation potential, antioxidant ability, gene and protein expression, cytotoxic effect, bone mineralization) using calvarial osteoblasts. For most peptides with the highest Peptide7 response relative to PepC (p < 0.05), enhanced osteoanabolic response was observed. Further observations on Peptide7 have therefore been investigated in depth (qPCR, immunoblotting, LCMS/MS, and PCA analysis). Peptide7 displayed a rise in the expression of osteogenes (Osterix, Opg, Bmp2, and Runx2, p < 0.05) and protein (Runx2 and Bmp2, p < 0.05). Besides, LCMS/MS findings suggest Peptide7 escapes intestinal peptidases degradation. Experimental evidence supports an improved osteological reaction to newly modified peptides and hence exploitation in the preparation of functional foods or supplements.	1) 10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2; 2) 10.1021/acs.jafc.0c03385	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	7	1	7	9.79e-07	7	0	0

The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.; 2) Proteolytic digestion of bovine β-lactoglobulin by trypsin yielded four peptide fragments with bactericidal activity. The peptides were isolated and their sequences were found as follows: VAGTWY (residues 15–20), AASDISLLDAQSAPLR (residues 25–40), IPAVFK (residues 78–83) and VLVLDTDYK (residues 92–100). The four peptides were synthesized and found to exert bactericidal effects against the Gram-positive bacteria only. In order to understand the structural requirements for antibacterial activity, the amino acid sequence of the peptide VLVLDTDYK was modified. The replacement of the Asp (98) residue by Arg and the addition of a Lys residue at the C-terminus yielded the peptide VLVLDTRYKK which enlarged the bactericidal activity spectrum to the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Bordetella bronchiseptica and significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide toward Bacillus subtilis. By data base searches with the sequence VLVLDTRYKK a high homology was found with the peptide VLVATLRYKK (residues 55–64) of human blue-sensitive opsin, the protein of the blue pigment responsible for color vision. A peptide with this sequence was synthesized and assayed for bactericidal activity. VLVATLRYKK was strongly active against all the bacterial strains tested. Our results suggest a possible antimicrobial function of β-lactoglobulin after its partial digestion by endopeptidases of the pancreas and show moreover that small targeted modifications in the sequence of β-lactoglobulin could be useful to increase its antimicrobial function.	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1016/s0304-4165(01)00116-7	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	9	1	9	3.24e-09	9	0	0

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 100.0	1	1) 6; 2) 7	1	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 9.79e-07; 2) 2.77e-05	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0

In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased. The peptides not hydrolysed by gastrointestinal enzymes and peptide VRYL, which was only partly hydrolysed, were incubated with ACE and were found to be true inhibitors of the enzyme and to have a competitive inhibition pattern.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.04.007	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 100.0	1	1) 6; 2) 7	1	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 9.79e-07; 2) 2.77e-05	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0

This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.; 2) Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.	1) 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.05.004; 2) 10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	25	2	26	3.22e-28	25	0	0

Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 2) Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).; 3) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 4) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.3390/foods9080991; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.02.011; 4) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 87.5	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 6	1) 1.36e-06; 2) 3.85e-05; 3) 2.77e-05	1) 6; 2) 7	0	0

The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) β-Casomorphin-7 (β-CM-7) is a milk biological active peptide. The present study is aimed to investigate the protective effects of β-CM-7, against oxidative stress in pancreas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by assaying malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) level, the activity of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and NF-κB, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. A significant increase in the level of oxidative stress was observed in pancreas of the diabetic rats when compared to control rats. After 15 d oral administration of β-CM-7 (7.5 × 10−8mol/d), the pancreas MDA level was markedly reduced. Oral administration of β-CM-7 to diabetic rats showed an obviously increase in the activity of catalase in pancreas, oral administration of β-CM-7 to the diabetic group of rats also showed a reduction of NF-κB and iNOS gene expression in pancreas. The elevated pancreas NO level was markedly reduced by the oral administration of β-CM-7. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that β-CM-7 may cause protective effects such as pronounced decreasing in oxidative stress and inhibiting NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal pathway in pancreas of diabetes rats.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02577.x	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls). Lactalbumin hydrolysate (5%) also evoked mucin discharge. In contrast, casein, and a mixture of amino acids was without effect. Chicken egg albumin and its hydrolysate or meat hydrolysate also did not modify mucin release. Interestingly, casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion was abolished by intra-arterial TTX or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). β-Casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide released from β-casein on milk ingestion, induced a strong mucin secretion (response at 563% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone. Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 2) We have recently shown that β-casomorphin-7, a milk opioid peptide, strongly stimulates mucin secretion in the rat jejunum through a nervous pathway and opioid receptor activation. In this study, the hypothesis that β-casomorphin-7 may also act directly on intestinal goblet cells was investigated in vitro in rat and human intestinal mucin-producing cells (DHE and HT29-MTX) using quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. The presence of μ-opioid receptors was demonstrated in rat goblet cells in the upper half of the colonic crypt and in the two cell lines by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In rat DHE cells, β-casomorphin-7 increased the expression of rat mucin (rMuc)2 and rMuc3 but not rMuc1, rMuc4, and rMuc5AC. This effect was time and dose dependent, with the maximum of increase in transcripts being noticed for a concentration of 10−4 M after 2 h of stimulation for rMuc2 (225% of controls) and 4 h of stimulation for rMuc3 (208% of controls). Mucin secretion was maximally increased after 8 h of stimulation. Interestingly, these effects were prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the μ-opioid antagonist cyprodime. In human HT29-MTX cells, β-casomorphin-7 (10−4 M) also increased MUC5AC mRNA levels (219% after 24 h of stimulation) and the secretion of this mucin (169% of controls). In conclusion, β-casomorphin-7 may contribute significantly to mucin production via a direct effect on intestinal goblet cells and the activation of μ-opioid receptors. Because intestinal mucins have a crucial mucosal protective function, dairy products containing β-casomorphin-7 may improve intestinal protection and could have dietary and health applications.; 3) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1152/ajpgi.00455.2005; 2) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.; 2) The hypothesis that dietary proteins or their hydrolysates may regulate intestinal mucin discharge was investigated in the isolated vascularly perfused rat jejunum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat intestinal mucins.

Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 3) Two opioid peptides with agonistic (β-casomorphin-5 and β-casomorphin-7) and three with antagonistic (casoxin-6, casoxin-C and lactoferroxin A) activity were determined in three semi-hard cheeses (Edamski, Gouda and Kasztelan) and in two ripening mould cheeses (Brie and Rokpol). β-Casomorphins (BCMs) were found at a higher level in the mould cheeses, whereas the opioid peptides with antagonistic activity were identified at a higher level in the semi-hard cheeses. The opioid activities of the peptide extracts from the cheeses were confirmed using isolated rabbit ileum.; 4) Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.; 5) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.10.011; 2) 10.1007/BF02019390; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499; 4) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 5) 10.1021/jf301279k	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	1) 3.85e-05; 2) 2.77e-05	6	0	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 88.89	1	8	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 1.63e-07; 2) 1.22e-07	8	0	0

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

Recently, some physiological significance of peptide fragments derived from milk proteins has been suggested. 1) It has recently been reported that synthetic peptide inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) possibly act as anti-amnestic agents. 2 ) In our previous paper,3) we described the synthesis of a number of peptide fragments of human β-casein, and found that PEP activity was inhibited by the synthetic pep tides within amino acid redidues 49-59 (Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro-Tyr) of β-casein, and the most potent inhibitor was Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-GluPro-Ile (50-57, IC50 = 8 11M)	10.1271/bbb.56.976	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	8	1	8	1) 8.77e-08; 2) 1.22e-07	8	0	0

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE).

The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 4) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4.

The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively.

Recently, some physiological significance of peptide fragments derived from milk proteins has been suggested. 1) It has recently been reported that synthetic peptide inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) possibly act as anti-amnestic agents. 2 ) In our previous paper,3) we described the synthesis of a number of peptide fragments of human β-casein, and found that PEP activity was inhibited by the synthetic pep tides within amino acid redidues 49-59 (Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro-Tyr) of β-casein, and the most potent inhibitor was Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-GluPro-Ile (50-57, IC50 = 8 11M)	10.1271/bbb.56.976	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	1	8	1) 1.81e-07; 2) 1.30e-07	8	0	0
VYPFPGPIHNS	P02666	VYPFPGPIPN	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	74-83	Antioxidant		6.2				1) Bioactive peptides generated in an enzyme membrane reactor using Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase; 2) Identification of New Peptides from Fermented Milk Showing Antioxidant Properties: Mechanism of Action	1) Tonolo, F. et al.; 2) Eisele, T. et al.	1) Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity.

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 94.44; 2) 89.47	1	18	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 6.49e-18; 2) 8.72e-18	18	1	0

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 4) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 5) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 6) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 6) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.0; 2) 88.89	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 8.77e-08; 2) 1.22e-07; 3) 4.50e-09	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 3) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 5) Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 6) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 7) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 8) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008; 4) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0; 5) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 6) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 7) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 8) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0; 3) 100.0; 4) 81.82	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 10; 3) 9; 4) 11	1) 6.62e-08; 2) 1.88e-10; 3) 1.81e-07; 4) 6.94e-09; 5) 5.00e-09; 6) 1.30e-07	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 1; 2) 0	0

Recently, some physiological significance of peptide fragments derived from milk proteins has been suggested. 1) It has recently been reported that synthetic peptide inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) possibly act as anti-amnestic agents. 2 ) In our previous paper,3) we described the synthesis of a number of peptide fragments of human β-casein, and found that PEP activity was inhibited by the synthetic pep tides within amino acid redidues 49-59 (Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro-Tyr) of β-casein, and the most potent inhibitor was Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-GluPro-Ile (50-57, IC50 = 8 11M)	10.1271/bbb.56.976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0	1	1) 8; 2) 9	1	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 1.30e-07; 2) 5.00e-09	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 5) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 5) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 81.82; 2) 90.91	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 9; 2) 10	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 10; 2) 9; 3) 11	1) 2.87e-10; 2) 7.37e-09; 3) 9.59e-08; 4) 1.02e-08	1) 9; 2) 10	1) 1; 2) 0	0

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known.

Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found.

The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates.

From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	1	18	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 5.64e-20; 2) 7.83e-20	18	0	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals.

The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	18	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 7.89e-20; 2) 1.10e-19	18	0	0

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 83.33; 2) 100.0	1) 1; 2) 3	12	1	1) 12; 2) 10	1) 6.38e-13; 2) 4.20e-10	1) 12; 2) 10	0	0

"Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

YLGYLE	P02662	YLGYLEQ	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	106-112	Antianxiety						1) In Vitro Digestibility of r-Casozepine, a Benzodiazepine-like Peptide from Bovine Casein, and Biological Activity of Its Main Proteolytic Fragment; 2) Transport Across Caco-2 Cell Monolayer and Sensitivity to Hydrolysis of Two Anxiolytic Peptides from αs1-Casein, α-Casozepine, and αs1-Casein-(f91-97): Effect of Bile Salts	Cakir-Kiefer, C. et al.	1) α-Casozepine is a peptide, corresponding to the sequence 91−100 of the bovine αs1-casein, displaying anxiolytic activity in the rat. The αs1-casein tryptic hydrolysate containing this peptide decreases stress effects after oral administration in various species including man. Therefore, the stability of this peptide toward gastric and pancreatic proteases has been assessed by using pepsin, chymotrypsin/trypsin, Corolase PP, pepsin followed by chymotrypsin/trypsin or pepsin followed by Corolase PP. α-Casozepine was slowly degraded by chymotrypsin, much more sensitive to pepsin and Corolase PP but not completely destroyed after 4 h kinetics. The bonds in the region 91 to 95 of the α-casozepine were totally resistant to hydrolysis by all studied proteases. Surprisingly, a fragment, corresponding to the sequence 91−97 and found in all the hydrolysis media in significant amount, possessed an anxiolytic activity in three behavioral tests measuring this parameter. This peptide could participate in the in vivo activity of α-casozepine.; 2) α-Casozepine and f91–97, peptides from αs1-casein, display anxiolytic activity in rats and may have to cross the intestinal epithelium to exert this central effect. We evaluated their resistance to hydrolysis by the peptidases of Caco-2 cells and their ability to cross the cell monolayer. To mimic physiological conditions, two preparations of bile salts were used in noncytotoxic concentrations: porcine bile extract and an equimolar mixture of taurocholate, cholate, and deoxycholate. The presence and composition of bile salts appeared to modulate the peptidase activities of the Caco-2 cells involved (i) in the hydrolysis of α-casozepine, leading to much higher formation of fragments f91–99, f91–98, and f91–97, and (ii) in the hydrolysis of f91–97, leading to lower degradation of this peptide. Transport of α-casozepine across Caco-2 monolayer increased significantly, in the presence of bile extract, and of fragment f91–97, in the presence of bile salts.	1) 10.1021/jf104089c; 2) 10.1021/jf202890e	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 83.33	1	1) 6; 2) 5	2	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 2.37e-05; 2) 6.95e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0

Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 100.0	1	6	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 6; 2) 7	1) 2.37e-05; 2) 1.71e-05	6	0	0

Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.; 2) Exorphins, peptides with opioid activity, have previously been isolated from pepsin hydrolysates of alpha-casein [Zioudrou, C., Streaty, R. A., & Klee, W. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2446-2449]. Analysis of these peptides shows that they correspond to the sequences 90-96, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu, and 90-95, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu, of alpha-casein. These peptides, as well as two of their analogues Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu (91-96) and Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu (91-95), have now been synthesized and characterized. Their opioid activity was examined by three different bioassays: (a) displacement of D-2-alanyl[tyrosyl-3,5-3H]enkephalin-(5-L-methioninamide) and [3H]dihydromorphine from rat brain membranes; (b) naloxone-reversible inhibition of adenylate cyclase in homogenates of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells; (c) naloxone-reversible inhibition of electrically stimulated contractions of the mouse vas deferens. The synthetic peptide of sequence 90-96 was the most potent opioid in all three bioassays and its potency was similar to that of the isolated alpha-casein exorphins. The synthetic peptides were totally resistant to hydrolysis by trypsin and homogenates of rat brain membranes, but were partially inactivated by chymotrypsin and subtilisin. The difference in opioid activity of alpha-casein exorphins may be related to differences in conformational flexibility observed by NMR spectroscopy.	1) 10.1021/bi00288a034; 2) 10.1021/jf301279k	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	6	1	6	1.71e-05	6	0	0

However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.; 2) Exorphins, peptides with opioid activity, have previously been isolated from pepsin hydrolysates of alpha-casein [Zioudrou, C., Streaty, R. A., & Klee, W. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2446-2449]. Analysis of these peptides shows that they correspond to the sequences 90-96, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu, and 90-95, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu, of alpha-casein. These peptides, as well as two of their analogues Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu (91-96) and Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu (91-95), have now been synthesized and characterized. Their opioid activity was examined by three different bioassays: (a) displacement of D-2-alanyl[tyrosyl-3,5-3H]enkephalin-(5-L-methioninamide) and [3H]dihydromorphine from rat brain membranes; (b) naloxone-reversible inhibition of adenylate cyclase in homogenates of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells; (c) naloxone-reversible inhibition of electrically stimulated contractions of the mouse vas deferens. The synthetic peptide of sequence 90-96 was the most potent opioid in all three bioassays and its potency was similar to that of the isolated alpha-casein exorphins. The synthetic peptides were totally resistant to hydrolysis by trypsin and homogenates of rat brain membranes, but were partially inactivated by chymotrypsin and subtilisin. The difference in opioid activity of alpha-casein exorphins may be related to differences in conformational flexibility observed by NMR spectroscopy.	1) 10.1021/bi00288a034; 2) 10.1021/jf301279k	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

The αs1-casein tryptic hydrolysate containing this peptide decreases stress effects after oral administration in various species including man. Therefore, the stability of this peptide toward gastric and pancreatic proteases has been assessed by using pepsin, chymotrypsin/trypsin, Corolase PP, pepsin followed by chymotrypsin/trypsin or pepsin followed by Corolase PP. α-Casozepine was slowly degraded by chymotrypsin, much more sensitive to pepsin and Corolase PP but not completely destroyed after 4 h kinetics. The bonds in the region 91 to 95 of the α-casozepine were totally resistant to hydrolysis by all studied proteases. Surprisingly, a fragment, corresponding to the sequence 91−97 and found in all the hydrolysis media in significant amount, possessed an anxiolytic activity in three behavioral tests measuring this parameter. This peptide could participate in the in vivo activity of α-casozepine.; 2) α-Casozepine and f91–97, peptides from αs1-casein, display anxiolytic activity in rats and may have to cross the intestinal epithelium to exert this central effect. We evaluated their resistance to hydrolysis by the peptidases of Caco-2 cells and their ability to cross the cell monolayer. To mimic physiological conditions, two preparations of bile salts were used in noncytotoxic concentrations: porcine bile extract and an equimolar mixture of taurocholate, cholate, and deoxycholate. The presence and composition of bile salts appeared to modulate the peptidase activities of the Caco-2 cells involved (i) in the hydrolysis of α-casozepine, leading to much higher formation of fragments f91–99, f91–98, and f91–97, and (ii) in the hydrolysis of f91–97, leading to lower degradation of this peptide. Transport of α-casozepine across Caco-2 monolayer increased significantly, in the presence of bile extract, and of fragment f91–97, in the presence of bile salts.; 3) Hydrolyzed infant formulas serve as appropriate nutritional sources for infants afflicted with cow’s milk allergy, and milk proteins in hydrolyzed formulas are industrially hydrolyzed extensively or partially. To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared. One standard, one extensively hydrolyzed, and one partially hydrolyzed infant formula were digested in vitro with pepsin and pancreatin, taking into account the higher gastric pH of infants, and the digesta were subjected to peptidomic analysis. The standard formula released a larger variety of bioactive peptides than from the hydrolyzed formulas, indicating that industrial hydrolysis of milk proteins may generally attenuate their indigenous bioactivities such as antibacterial, immuno-regulatory, and anti-oxidative activities. Conversely, industrial hydrolysis may facilitate the formation of bioactive peptides from hydrophobic proteins/regions such as β-LG and the “strategic zone” of β-CN, which encrypt bioactive peptides including a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4-inhibitory, hypocholesterolemic, and opioid peptides. Infants fed hydrolyzed infant formulas may be influenced by milk protein-derived bioactive peptides in a manner different from those fed standard formula.	1) 10.1021/jf202890e; 2) 10.1021/jf104089c; 3) 10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.005	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 87.5	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 1.55e-06; 2) 1.04e-07	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 2) Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).; 3) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.02.011; 2) 10.3390/foods9080991; 3) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 83.33	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 1; 2) 2	6	1) 2.37e-05; 2) 6.95e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 83.33	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 2.37e-05; 2) 5.00e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0

The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) β-Casomorphin-7 (β-CM-7) is a milk biological active peptide. The present study is aimed to investigate the protective effects of β-CM-7, against oxidative stress in pancreas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by assaying malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) level, the activity of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and NF-κB, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. A significant increase in the level of oxidative stress was observed in pancreas of the diabetic rats when compared to control rats. After 15 d oral administration of β-CM-7 (7.5 × 10−8mol/d), the pancreas MDA level was markedly reduced. Oral administration of β-CM-7 to diabetic rats showed an obviously increase in the activity of catalase in pancreas, oral administration of β-CM-7 to the diabetic group of rats also showed a reduction of NF-κB and iNOS gene expression in pancreas. The elevated pancreas NO level was markedly reduced by the oral administration of β-CM-7. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that β-CM-7 may cause protective effects such as pronounced decreasing in oxidative stress and inhibiting NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal pathway in pancreas of diabetes rats.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02577.x	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0

In the present study in vivo impact of consumption of β-casomorphins (BCM-7/5) was evaluated on immune response of murine gut. The peptides were given to mice through oral intubation at a dose of 7.5 × 10−8 mol/day/animal for 15 days. Oral administration of both peptides individually increased (p <0.01) phenotypic expression of inflammation associated molecules (MPO, MCP-1, IL-4 and histamine), humoral immune response (IgE, IgG, IgG1/IgG2a), infiltration of leucocytes in intestinal villi and mRNA expression of toll like receptors (TLR-2 and TLR-4) in mice gut. However, no changes in sIgA, IgA+ and goblet cell numbers were recorded. These results clearly indicate that consumption of β-casein derived peptides BCM-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in gut, most likely through Th2 pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.03.018	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 85.71; 2) 83.33	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 2.37e-05; 2) 5.00e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0

Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of β-casomorphin-5 (0.1–20 mg/kg) did not have a significant effect on either spontaneous alternation behavior or passive avoidance response. However, a low dose (1 mg/kg, i.p.) of β-casomorphin-5 improved scopolamine (1 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation behavior and passive avoidance response. Pretreatment with intracerebroventricular injections of β-funaltrexamine (a μ-opioid receptor antagonist, 0.1 μg/mouse) and naloxonazine (a μ1-opioid antagonist, 5 μg/mouse), which did not improve scopolamine-induced impairment, prevented the ameliorating effect of β-casomorphin-5 on scopolamine-induced impairment of passive avoidance response. These results indicated that systemic administration of a low dose (1 mg/kg, i.p.) of β-casomorphin-5 improves the disturbance of learning and memory resulting from cholinergic dysfunction through central mediation involving μ1-opioid receptors.; 2) Endogenous opioid peptides and opiate drugs are known to affect the development of the nervous system. β-Casomorphins (β-CMs) belong to a family of exogenous opioid peptides derived from the milk protein β-casein by proteolytic fragmentation. We investigated the effects of various fragments and analogues of β-CM on neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells. The fragments β-CM-5 to -9 and β-CM-5 amide stimulated neurite outgrowth. Fragments shorter than β-CM-5 (β-CM-3, -4, and β-CM-4 amide) and longer than β-CM-9 (β-CM-13 and -21) had no effects. The activity of β-CMs to promote neurite outgrowth does not correlate with their opioid activity in guinea-pig ileum. The effect of the most potent fragment, β-CM-5, was prevented by the μ-opioid receptor-selectiveantagonist D-Phe-Cys2-Tyr3-D-Trp-Orn5-Thr6-Pen7- Thr8-NH2 (CTOP), or by pretreatment with pertussis toxin. These results suggest that the stimulatory effects of β-CMs on neurite outgrowth were mediated through G protein-coupled μ-opioid receptors.	1) 10.1271/bbb.67.2541; 2) 10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.11.014	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	5	1	5	5.00e-04	5	0	0

On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls). Lactalbumin hydrolysate (5%) also evoked mucin discharge. In contrast, casein, and a mixture of amino acids was without effect. Chicken egg albumin and its hydrolysate or meat hydrolysate also did not modify mucin release. Interestingly, casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion was abolished by intra-arterial TTX or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). β-Casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide released from β-casein on milk ingestion, induced a strong mucin secretion (response at 563% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone. Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 2) We have recently shown that β-casomorphin-7, a milk opioid peptide, strongly stimulates mucin secretion in the rat jejunum through a nervous pathway and opioid receptor activation. In this study, the hypothesis that β-casomorphin-7 may also act directly on intestinal goblet cells was investigated in vitro in rat and human intestinal mucin-producing cells (DHE and HT29-MTX) using quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. The presence of μ-opioid receptors was demonstrated in rat goblet cells in the upper half of the colonic crypt and in the two cell lines by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In rat DHE cells, β-casomorphin-7 increased the expression of rat mucin (rMuc)2 and rMuc3 but not rMuc1, rMuc4, and rMuc5AC. This effect was time and dose dependent, with the maximum of increase in transcripts being noticed for a concentration of 10−4 M after 2 h of stimulation for rMuc2 (225% of controls) and 4 h of stimulation for rMuc3 (208% of controls). Mucin secretion was maximally increased after 8 h of stimulation. Interestingly, these effects were prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the μ-opioid antagonist cyprodime. In human HT29-MTX cells, β-casomorphin-7 (10−4 M) also increased MUC5AC mRNA levels (219% after 24 h of stimulation) and the secretion of this mucin (169% of controls). In conclusion, β-casomorphin-7 may contribute significantly to mucin production via a direct effect on intestinal goblet cells and the activation of μ-opioid receptors. Because intestinal mucins have a crucial mucosal protective function, dairy products containing β-casomorphin-7 may improve intestinal protection and could have dietary and health applications.; 3) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1152/ajpgi.00455.2005; 2) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0

Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.; 2) The hypothesis that dietary proteins or their hydrolysates may regulate intestinal mucin discharge was investigated in the isolated vascularly perfused rat jejunum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat intestinal mucins.

Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 3) Two opioid peptides with agonistic (β-casomorphin-5 and β-casomorphin-7) and three with antagonistic (casoxin-6, casoxin-C and lactoferroxin A) activity were determined in three semi-hard cheeses (Edamski, Gouda and Kasztelan) and in two ripening mould cheeses (Brie and Rokpol). β-Casomorphins (BCMs) were found at a higher level in the mould cheeses, whereas the opioid peptides with antagonistic activity were identified at a higher level in the semi-hard cheeses. The opioid activities of the peptide extracts from the cheeses were confirmed using isolated rabbit ileum.; 4) Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.; 5) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.10.011; 2) 10.1007/BF02019390; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499; 4) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 5) 10.1021/jf301279k	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 83.33; 2) 85.71; 3) 100.0	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1	1) 6; 2) 5	1) 2.37e-05; 2) 1.71e-05; 3) 5.00e-04	1) 6; 2) 5	0	0

Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals.

The present study is aimed to investigate the protective effects of β-CM-7, against oxidative stress in pancreas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by assaying malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) level, the activity of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and NF-κB, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. A significant increase in the level of oxidative stress was observed in pancreas of the diabetic rats when compared to control rats. After 15 d oral administration of β-CM-7 (7.5 × 10−8mol/d), the pancreas MDA level was markedly reduced. Oral administration of β-CM-7 to diabetic rats showed an obviously increase in the activity of catalase in pancreas, oral administration of β-CM-7 to the diabetic group of rats also showed a reduction of NF-κB and iNOS gene expression in pancreas. The elevated pancreas NO level was markedly reduced by the oral administration of β-CM-7. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that β-CM-7 may cause protective effects such as pronounced decreasing in oxidative stress and inhibiting NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal pathway in pancreas of diabetes rats.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02577.x	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 100.0	1	7	1	7	1) 9.79e-07; 2) 1.36e-06	7	0	0

On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls). Lactalbumin hydrolysate (5%) also evoked mucin discharge. In contrast, casein, and a mixture of amino acids was without effect. Chicken egg albumin and its hydrolysate or meat hydrolysate also did not modify mucin release. Interestingly, casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion was abolished by intra-arterial TTX or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). β-Casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide released from β-casein on milk ingestion, induced a strong mucin secretion (response at 563% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone. Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 2) We have recently shown that β-casomorphin-7, a milk opioid peptide, strongly stimulates mucin secretion in the rat jejunum through a nervous pathway and opioid receptor activation. In this study, the hypothesis that β-casomorphin-7 may also act directly on intestinal goblet cells was investigated in vitro in rat and human intestinal mucin-producing cells (DHE and HT29-MTX) using quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. The presence of μ-opioid receptors was demonstrated in rat goblet cells in the upper half of the colonic crypt and in the two cell lines by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In rat DHE cells, β-casomorphin-7 increased the expression of rat mucin (rMuc)2 and rMuc3 but not rMuc1, rMuc4, and rMuc5AC. This effect was time and dose dependent, with the maximum of increase in transcripts being noticed for a concentration of 10−4 M after 2 h of stimulation for rMuc2 (225% of controls) and 4 h of stimulation for rMuc3 (208% of controls). Mucin secretion was maximally increased after 8 h of stimulation. Interestingly, these effects were prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the μ-opioid antagonist cyprodime. In human HT29-MTX cells, β-casomorphin-7 (10−4 M) also increased MUC5AC mRNA levels (219% after 24 h of stimulation) and the secretion of this mucin (169% of controls). In conclusion, β-casomorphin-7 may contribute significantly to mucin production via a direct effect on intestinal goblet cells and the activation of μ-opioid receptors. Because intestinal mucins have a crucial mucosal protective function, dairy products containing β-casomorphin-7 may improve intestinal protection and could have dietary and health applications.; 3) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1152/ajpgi.00455.2005; 2) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	7	1	7	9.79e-07	7	0	0

Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.; 2) The hypothesis that dietary proteins or their hydrolysates may regulate intestinal mucin discharge was investigated in the isolated vascularly perfused rat jejunum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat intestinal mucins.

The present study is aimed to investigate the protective effects of β-CM-7, against oxidative stress in pancreas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by assaying malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) level, the activity of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and NF-κB, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. A significant increase in the level of oxidative stress was observed in pancreas of the diabetic rats when compared to control rats. After 15 d oral administration of β-CM-7 (7.5 × 10−8mol/d), the pancreas MDA level was markedly reduced. Oral administration of β-CM-7 to diabetic rats showed an obviously increase in the activity of catalase in pancreas, oral administration of β-CM-7 to the diabetic group of rats also showed a reduction of NF-κB and iNOS gene expression in pancreas. The elevated pancreas NO level was markedly reduced by the oral administration of β-CM-7. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that β-CM-7 may cause protective effects such as pronounced decreasing in oxidative stress and inhibiting NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal pathway in pancreas of diabetes rats.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02577.x	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1) 2.16e-06; 2) 1.55e-06	7	0	0

On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls). Lactalbumin hydrolysate (5%) also evoked mucin discharge. In contrast, casein, and a mixture of amino acids was without effect. Chicken egg albumin and its hydrolysate or meat hydrolysate also did not modify mucin release. Interestingly, casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion was abolished by intra-arterial TTX or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). β-Casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide released from β-casein on milk ingestion, induced a strong mucin secretion (response at 563% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone. Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 2) We have recently shown that β-casomorphin-7, a milk opioid peptide, strongly stimulates mucin secretion in the rat jejunum through a nervous pathway and opioid receptor activation. In this study, the hypothesis that β-casomorphin-7 may also act directly on intestinal goblet cells was investigated in vitro in rat and human intestinal mucin-producing cells (DHE and HT29-MTX) using quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. The presence of μ-opioid receptors was demonstrated in rat goblet cells in the upper half of the colonic crypt and in the two cell lines by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In rat DHE cells, β-casomorphin-7 increased the expression of rat mucin (rMuc)2 and rMuc3 but not rMuc1, rMuc4, and rMuc5AC. This effect was time and dose dependent, with the maximum of increase in transcripts being noticed for a concentration of 10−4 M after 2 h of stimulation for rMuc2 (225% of controls) and 4 h of stimulation for rMuc3 (208% of controls). Mucin secretion was maximally increased after 8 h of stimulation. Interestingly, these effects were prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the μ-opioid antagonist cyprodime. In human HT29-MTX cells, β-casomorphin-7 (10−4 M) also increased MUC5AC mRNA levels (219% after 24 h of stimulation) and the secretion of this mucin (169% of controls). In conclusion, β-casomorphin-7 may contribute significantly to mucin production via a direct effect on intestinal goblet cells and the activation of μ-opioid receptors. Because intestinal mucins have a crucial mucosal protective function, dairy products containing β-casomorphin-7 may improve intestinal protection and could have dietary and health applications.; 3) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1152/ajpgi.00455.2005; 2) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.; 2) The hypothesis that dietary proteins or their hydrolysates may regulate intestinal mucin discharge was investigated in the isolated vascularly perfused rat jejunum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat intestinal mucins. On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls). Lactalbumin hydrolysate (5%) also evoked mucin discharge. In contrast, casein, and a mixture of amino acids was without effect. Chicken egg albumin and its hydrolysate or meat hydrolysate also did not modify mucin release. Interestingly, casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion was abolished by intra-arterial TTX or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). β-Casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide released from β-casein on milk ingestion, induced a strong mucin secretion (response at 563% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone. Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 3) Two opioid peptides with agonistic (β-casomorphin-5 and β-casomorphin-7) and three with antagonistic (casoxin-6, casoxin-C and lactoferroxin A) activity were determined in three semi-hard cheeses (Edamski, Gouda and Kasztelan) and in two ripening mould cheeses (Brie and Rokpol). β-Casomorphins (BCMs) were found at a higher level in the mould cheeses, whereas the opioid peptides with antagonistic activity were identified at a higher level in the semi-hard cheeses. The opioid activities of the peptide extracts from the cheeses were confirmed using isolated rabbit ileum.; 4) Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.; 5) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum.

In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge.

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 3) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively.

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 3) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 3) 10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	9	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 9; 2) 10	1) 1.29e-06; 2) 1.69e-06	9	1	0

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 2) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 81.25	1	1) 14; 2) 13	3	1) 16; 2) 15	1) 2.34e-11; 2) 9.54e-13	1) 14; 2) 13	1	0

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 84.21; 2) 88.89	1	17	1) 3; 2) 2	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 2.76e-16; 2) 2.10e-16	17	1	0

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of several infant formulas was evaluated. Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 5) Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 6) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.02.011; 2) 10.3390/foods9080991; 3) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 4) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 6) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 87.5; 3) 100.0; 4) 88.89	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 8; 2) 7; 3) 9; 4) 10	1) 7.79e-08; 2) 1.04e-07; 3) 2.16e-06; 4) 5.62e-08; 5) 1.55e-06	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for δ-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of β-casomorphin (CM-10) (β-casein 60–69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards δ- and μ-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for δ- and μ-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized δ-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of δ- or μ-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut δ- and/or μ-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.; 2) The effects of wheat gluten fragments, hemoglobin, and milk β-caseins (exorphine C, hemorphine-6, and β-casomorphine-7) on nociceptive sensitivity and behavior were studied in albino rats. Hemorphine-6 and exorphine C induced hyperalgesia and increased anxiety; β-casomorphine-7 decreased anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. All peptides partially decreased motor activity and the orientative-exploring reaction. In contrast to β-casomorphine-7, exorphine C and hemorphine-6 did not exhibit neurotropic activity intrinsic to opioids and can be characterized as functional antagonists of endogenous opioid peptides.	1) 10.1039/d2fo01793h; 2) 10.1007/BF02496839	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 87.5	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 1.55e-06; 2) 1.04e-07	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 3) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 4) β-Casomorphin-7 (β-CM-7) is a milk biological active peptide. The present study is aimed to investigate the protective effects of β-CM-7, against oxidative stress in pancreas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by assaying malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) level, the activity of enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and NF-κB, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression. A significant increase in the level of oxidative stress was observed in pancreas of the diabetic rats when compared to control rats. After 15 d oral administration of β-CM-7 (7.5 × 10−8mol/d), the pancreas MDA level was markedly reduced. Oral administration of β-CM-7 to diabetic rats showed an obviously increase in the activity of catalase in pancreas, oral administration of β-CM-7 to the diabetic group of rats also showed a reduction of NF-κB and iNOS gene expression in pancreas. The elevated pancreas NO level was markedly reduced by the oral administration of β-CM-7. Thus, the results of the present study suggest that β-CM-7 may cause protective effects such as pronounced decreasing in oxidative stress and inhibiting NF-κB-iNOS-NO signal pathway in pancreas of diabetes rats.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 3) 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02577.x; 4) 10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 87.5; 3) 100.0; 4) 88.89	1	1) 8; 2) 7	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 7; 3) 9	1) 1.55e-06; 2) 5.62e-08; 3) 7.79e-08; 4) 1.04e-07	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls). Lactalbumin hydrolysate (5%) also evoked mucin discharge. In contrast, casein, and a mixture of amino acids was without effect. Chicken egg albumin and its hydrolysate or meat hydrolysate also did not modify mucin release. Interestingly, casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion was abolished by intra-arterial TTX or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). β-Casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide released from β-casein on milk ingestion, induced a strong mucin secretion (response at 563% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone. Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 2) We have recently shown that β-casomorphin-7, a milk opioid peptide, strongly stimulates mucin secretion in the rat jejunum through a nervous pathway and opioid receptor activation. In this study, the hypothesis that β-casomorphin-7 may also act directly on intestinal goblet cells was investigated in vitro in rat and human intestinal mucin-producing cells (DHE and HT29-MTX) using quantitative and semiquantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. The presence of μ-opioid receptors was demonstrated in rat goblet cells in the upper half of the colonic crypt and in the two cell lines by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In rat DHE cells, β-casomorphin-7 increased the expression of rat mucin (rMuc)2 and rMuc3 but not rMuc1, rMuc4, and rMuc5AC. This effect was time and dose dependent, with the maximum of increase in transcripts being noticed for a concentration of 10−4 M after 2 h of stimulation for rMuc2 (225% of controls) and 4 h of stimulation for rMuc3 (208% of controls). Mucin secretion was maximally increased after 8 h of stimulation. Interestingly, these effects were prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the μ-opioid antagonist cyprodime. In human HT29-MTX cells, β-casomorphin-7 (10−4 M) also increased MUC5AC mRNA levels (219% after 24 h of stimulation) and the secretion of this mucin (169% of controls). In conclusion, β-casomorphin-7 may contribute significantly to mucin production via a direct effect on intestinal goblet cells and the activation of μ-opioid receptors. Because intestinal mucins have a crucial mucosal protective function, dairy products containing β-casomorphin-7 may improve intestinal protection and could have dietary and health applications.; 3) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1152/ajpgi.00455.2005; 2) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells.; 2) The hypothesis that dietary proteins or their hydrolysates may regulate intestinal mucin discharge was investigated in the isolated vascularly perfused rat jejunum using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rat intestinal mucins. On luminal administration, casein hydrolysate [0.05–5% (wt/vol)] stimulated mucin secretion in rat jejunum (maximal response at 417% of controls). Lactalbumin hydrolysate (5%) also evoked mucin discharge. In contrast, casein, and a mixture of amino acids was without effect. Chicken egg albumin and its hydrolysate or meat hydrolysate also did not modify mucin release. Interestingly, casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion was abolished by intra-arterial TTX or naloxone (an opioid antagonist). β-Casomorphin-7, an opioid peptide released from β-casein on milk ingestion, induced a strong mucin secretion (response at 563% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone. Intra-arterial β-casomorphin-7 also markedly increased mucin secretion (410% of controls). In conclusion, two enzymatic milk protein hydrolysates (casein and lactalbumin hydrolysates) and β-casomorphin-7, specifically, induced mucin release in rat jejunum. The casein hydrolysate-induced mucin secretion is triggered by a neural pathway and mediated by opioid receptor activation.; 3) Two opioid peptides with agonistic (β-casomorphin-5 and β-casomorphin-7) and three with antagonistic (casoxin-6, casoxin-C and lactoferroxin A) activity were determined in three semi-hard cheeses (Edamski, Gouda and Kasztelan) and in two ripening mould cheeses (Brie and Rokpol). β-Casomorphins (BCMs) were found at a higher level in the mould cheeses, whereas the opioid peptides with antagonistic activity were identified at a higher level in the semi-hard cheeses. The opioid activities of the peptide extracts from the cheeses were confirmed using isolated rabbit ileum.; 4) Bioactive peptides have been identified as digestion products of several food proteins. All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.; 5) Intestinal mucus is critically involved in the protection of the mucosa. An enzymatic casein hydrolysate and beta-casomorphin-7, a mu-opioid peptide generated in the intestine during bovine casein digestion, markedly induce mucus discharge. Because shorter mu-opioid peptides have been described, the effects of the opioid peptides in casein, beta-casomorphin-7, -6, -4, -4NH2 and -3, and of opioid neuropeptides met-enkephalin, dynorphin A and (D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,glycinol5)enkephalin (DAMGO) on intestinal mucus secretion were investigated. The experiments were conducted with isolated perfused rat jejunum. Mucus secretion under the influence of beta-casomorphins and opioid neuropeptides administered intraluminally or intra-arterially was evaluated using an ELISA for rat intestinal mucus. Luminal administration of beta-casomorphin-7 (1.2 x 10(-4) mol/L) provoked a mucus discharge (500% of controls) that was inhibited by naloxone, a specific opiate receptor antagonist. Luminal beta-casomorphin-6, -4 and -4NH2 did not modify basal mucus secretion, whereas intra-arterial administration of beta-casomorphin-4 (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a mucus discharge. In contrast, intra-arterial administration of the nonopioid peptide beta-casomorphin-3 did not release mucus. Among the opioid neuropeptides, intra-arterial infusion of Met-enkephalin or dynorphin-A did not provoke mucus secretion. In contrast, beta-endorphin (1.2 x 10(-8) to 1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L) induced a dose-dependent release of mucus (maximal response at 500% of controls). DAMGO (1.2 x 10(-6) mol/L), a mu-receptor agonist, also evoked a potent mucus discharge. Our findings suggest that mu-opioid neuropeptides, as well as beta-casomorphins after absorption, modulate intestinal mucus discharge. Milk opioid-derived peptides may thus be involved in defense against noxious agents and could have dietary and health applications.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.10.011; 2) 10.1007/BF02019390; 3) 10.1093/jn/133.11.3499; 4) 10.1152/ajpgi.00535.2001; 5) 10.1021/jf301279k	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Recently, some physiological significance of peptide fragments derived from milk proteins has been suggested. 1) It has recently been reported that synthetic peptide inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) possibly act as anti-amnestic agents. 2 ) In our previous paper,3) we described the synthesis of a number of peptide fragments of human β-casein, and found that PEP activity was inhibited by the synthetic pep tides within amino acid redidues 49-59 (Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro-Tyr) of β-casein, and the most potent inhibitor was Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-GluPro-Ile (50-57, IC50 = 8 11M)	10.1271/bbb.56.976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 88.89	1	1) 8; 2) 7	2	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 2.16e-06; 2) 7.79e-08	1) 8; 2) 7	0	0

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 4) Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 5) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 5) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0; 3) 100.0; 4) 88.89	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 1.63e-07; 2) 8.77e-08; 3) 3.24e-09; 4) 4.50e-09	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known.

The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 4) Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 5) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 5) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 90.0	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 1.30e-07; 2) 6.94e-09; 3) 5.00e-09; 4) 2.43e-07	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 3) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.	1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 94.44; 2) 89.47	1	17	1) 3; 2) 2	1) 19; 2) 18	1) 9.24e-19; 2) 1.26e-18	17	0	0

All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.; 2) Opioid antagonists were sought in the fragments of κ-casein which were obtained by chemical synthesis and enzymic digestion. A synthetic bovine κ-casein peptide (35–41), Tyr-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Asn (casoxin A) showed opioid antagonist activity at 200 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. A synthetic peptide Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr (casoxin B) which is found in bovine and human κ-casein, also showed opioid antagonist activity at 100 μM. Another opioid antagonist peptide (casoxin C) was isolated from tryptic digests of bovine κ-casein by reverse-phase HPLC. The structure of the peptide was Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg, which corresponded to κ-casein (25–34). Casoxin C was active at 5 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. Thus, bovine κ-casein contains three potential opioid antagonist sequences.	1) 10.1017/s0022029900028818; 2) 10.1007/BF02019390	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 87.5; 2) 100.0	1	7	1	7	1) 9.79e-07; 2) 1.36e-06	7	0	0

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.	1) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0
YPVEPFT	P02666	YPVEPF	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Opioid						1) β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells; 2) Enzymatic release of neocasomorphin and  β-casomorphin from bovine  β-casein	1) Plaisancie, P. et al.; 2) Jinsmaa, Y.den. et al.	1) We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.; 2) Conditions for the release of β-casomorphin-7 from bovine β-casein by gastrointestinal proteases in vitro were investigated. β-Casomorphin-7 was released only from a genetic variant of β-casein containing a His residue at the 67th position of the peptide chain. Elastase cleaved the peptide bond between Ile66 and His67, releasing the carboxyl terminus of β-casomorphin-7. Pepsin and leucine aminopeptidase were required to release the amino terminus of this peptide. β-Casomorphin-9, -13, and -21 also were isolated, and their opioid activities were measured. In this study, we also isolated a novel opioid peptide neocasomorphin-6 (Tyr-Pro-Val-Glu-Pro-Phe), which was released by action of trypsin or pepsin and chymotrypsin.	1) 10.1016/s0196-9781(99)00088-1; 2) 10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 80.0; 2) 100.0	1	8	1	8	1) 5.62e-08; 2) 1.04e-07	8	0	0

Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages.

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases.

Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 3) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 4) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 3) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.0; 2) 88.89; 3) 81.82	1	1) 8; 2) 9	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 8; 2) 9; 3) 10	1) 8.77e-08; 2) 6.03e-09; 3) 4.50e-09	1) 8; 2) 9	0	0

The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.1016/0014-5793(96)00207-4; 2) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 3) 10.1007/s10989-018-9708-7	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 90.0; 2) 81.82	1	9	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 9; 2) 10	1) 6.03e-09; 2) 4.50e-09	9	0	0

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 4) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 5) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity.

Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase).

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases.

These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	1) 10.1016/0014-5793(96)00207-4; 2) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 3) 10.1007/s10989-018-9708-7	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	1	10	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 10; 2) 11	1) 3.98e-10; 2) 2.87e-10	10	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 4) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 5) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant.

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	1	12	1.57e-12	12	0	0

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase). Declined (p < 0.01) mRNA expression of a transcription factor (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor: Nrf-2) involved in redox signalling further established the protective effect of peptide against oxidative stress induced injury; 3) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins.

Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation.

The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 82.35; 2) 85.71; 3) 81.25	1) 1; 2) 3; 3) 2	14	1	1) 14; 2) 12; 3) 13	1) 1.39e-12; 2) 1.39e-13; 3) 5.46e-15	1) 14; 2) 12; 3) 13	0	0

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown.

Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities.

Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.; 2) A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	1) 10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2; 2) 10.1093/jn/131.11.2936	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 83.33; 2) 88.24	1	15	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 16; 2) 15	1) 2.44e-16; 2) 3.23e-16	15	0	0

Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.; 2) A casein polypeptidic fraction, obtained from a pepsin-chymosin digestion of caseins, showed a mitogenic effect on primed lymph node (LN) cells and unprimed spleen cells of rats. A biologically active C-terminal sequence of bovine β-casein (residues 192–209) was characterized. The corresponding synthetic peptide had a stimulatory effect on primed LN cells but failed to enhance proliferation of spleen cells. We prepared two chymosin digests (PA and PB) of bovine β-casein which contained, respectively, 80% and 95% of the sequence including residues 193–209. They induced a significant proliferative response in both LN and spleen cells. It is therefore possible that other active peptides in the PA preparation may be involved in mitogenic activity.	1) 10.1016/0165-2478(92)90091-2; 2) 10.1093/jn/131.11.2936	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 88.89; 2) 94.12	1	16	1) 1; 2) 2	1) 16; 2) 17	1) 1.44e-17; 2) 1.06e-17	16	0	0

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 89.47; 2) 100.0; 3) 94.12	1) 1; 2) 2	17	1) 1; 2) 3	1) 16; 2) 19; 3) 17	1) 1.13e-17; 2) 8.54e-19; 3) 4.53e-19	1) 16; 2) 17	0	0

"1) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey."	1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	1) 100.0; 2) 88.24	1	1) 15; 2) 17	1	1) 15; 2) 17	1) 2.76e-16; 2) 4.53e-19	1) 15; 2) 17	0	0

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed.

Food-derived bioactive peptides are considered as the important sources of natural bioactive ingredients. Approximately 3094 peptides were identified by nESI-LC–MS/MS in the hydrolyzed yak milk residue. Peptide KALNEINQF (T10) is the strongest antioxidant peptide. The damage model of H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was used to evaluate the antioxidant effect. After treatment with 25, 50, or 100 μg/mL T10 peptide, T10 obviously decreased H2O2-induced damage and increased the cell survival. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were significantly increased 1.03, 1.1, and 1.33 times, and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were significantly increased 1.11, 1.30, and 1.43 times, respectively. Malondialdehyde (MDA) also reduced 1.41, 1.54, and 1.72 times, respectively. T10 inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVECs, and protein expressions of the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2 and bax were increased and decreased by 1.95 and 1.44 times, respectively, suggesting T10 decreases apoptosis of the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, the RNA expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.00, 2.11, and 1.94 times; the protein expressions of p-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.67, 1.73, and 1.04 times; and Keap1 was downregulated by 3.9 and 1.32 times, respectively. T10 also regulated the Nrf2 pathway and expressions of related genes (Keap1, HO-1, and NQO1), and blocking the Nrf2 pathway in the model decreased the protective effect of T10. Taken together, T10 peptide isolated from yak milk residue has a protective effect against H2O2-induced damage in HUVECs and the molecular mechanisms are involved in the regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and cell apoptosis.	10.1155/2021/9426314	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	8	2	9	7.79e-08	8	0	0

Multifunctional bioactive peptides have a wider role in modulating physiological functions and possess multiple biological activities. Peptides from bovine milk with sequences QKALNEINQF [p10] and TKKTKLTEEEKNRL [p14] from α-S2 casein f (79–88) and α-S2 casein f (148–161) were identified to be having multifunctional biological activities and were synthesized. These synthesized peptides show various biological activities like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, prolyl endopeptidase inhibition, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The mode of antimicrobial mechanism was studied and p10 shows depolarization of cell membrane, whereas p14 was found to display DNA-binding activity. Structural studies envisaged backbone flexibility, for differences in their mode of action. Peptide structure function studies were correlated to understand their multifunctional biological activity.	10.1007/s11010-013-1778-4	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.04e-07	8	0	0
ALPQYLK	P02663	FALPQYLK	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	189-196	Antioxidant						Casein hydrolysates as a source of antimicrobial, antioxidant and antihypertensive peptides	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	 The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox. From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively). The latter sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of the ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein molecule, also had antioxidant activity. The activity found is discussed in relation to the peptide sequences. 	10.1051/lait:2007019	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	2	8	1.36e-06	7	0	0

Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1	9	1	9	7.37e-09	9	0	0

Template-based studies on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derivatives obtained through manipulation of the amino acid sequence are helpful to identify properties or residues that are important for biological activity. The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.	10.1128/AEM.01394-13	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	2	13	1.57e-12	12	0	0

ARHPHPHLSF	P02669	HPHPHLSF	Kappa-casein	Ovis aries	119-126	Osteoanabolic						Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation	Reddi, S. et al.	Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.	10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0

Proteolytic digestion of bovine β-lactoglobulin by trypsin yielded four peptide fragments with bactericidal activity. The peptides were isolated and their sequences were found as follows: VAGTWY (residues 15–20), AASDISLLDAQSAPLR (residues 25–40), IPAVFK (residues 78–83) and VLVLDTDYK (residues 92–100). The four peptides were synthesized and found to exert bactericidal effects against the Gram-positive bacteria only. In order to understand the structural requirements for antibacterial activity, the amino acid sequence of the peptide VLVLDTDYK was modified. The replacement of the Asp (98) residue by Arg and the addition of a Lys residue at the C-terminus yielded the peptide VLVLDTRYKK which enlarged the bactericidal activity spectrum to the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Bordetella bronchiseptica and significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide toward Bacillus subtilis. By data base searches with the sequence VLVLDTRYKK a high homology was found with the peptide VLVATLRYKK (residues 55–64) of human blue-sensitive opsin, the protein of the blue pigment responsible for color vision. A peptide with this sequence was synthesized and assayed for bactericidal activity. VLVATLRYKK was strongly active against all the bacterial strains tested. Our results suggest a possible antimicrobial function of β-lactoglobulin after its partial digestion by endopeptidases of the pancreas and show moreover that small targeted modifications in the sequence of β-lactoglobulin could be useful to increase its antimicrobial function.	10.1016/s0304-4165(01)00116-7	sequence	IDENTITY	93.75	1	15	2	16	1.80e-16	15	0	0
AVPITPTLNR	A0A1L6KYI1	NAVPITPTL	Alpha-S2-casein	Bubalus bubalis	130-138	Osteoanabolic						Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation.	Reddi, S. et al.	Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.	10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	2	9	1.81e-07	8	0	0

The aim of this study was to investigate the dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibition and metabolic stability of a casein-derived peptide Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln (VPYPQ) and its fragments as well as their release from casein following hydrolysis. Results showed that VPYPQ was the most potent DPP-IV inhibitory peptide among them with an IC50 value of 41.45 μM. This might be due to its two internal Pro residues at positions 2 and 4. Moreover, VPYPQ was resistant to hydrolysis by gastrointestinal enzymes and was relatively more stable to hydrolysis by DPP-IV and peptidases in plasma compared with its fragments. Additionally, oral administration of VPYPQ at a dose of 90 μmol/kg body weight could reduce the postprandial blood glucose levels in mice. More importantly, VPYPQ could be released efficiently from casein following hydrolysis by a combination of papain and in vitro digestion, reaching up to 3211.15 μg/g. Therefore, VPYPQ was a promising casein-derived DPP-IV inhibitor.	10.1021/acs.jafc.9b03164	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	6	1	5	5.00e-04	5	0	0

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

AVRSPAQILQ	P02668	PAAVRSPAQILQ	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	85-96	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	E. coli		Identification of antibacterial peptides from bovine kappa-casein	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	The objective of the present study was to identify antimicrobial peptides present in several digests of commercial caseins with gastric enzymes. The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992 	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	10	3	12	3.50e-10	10	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	10	1	10	3.50e-10	10	0	0

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	10	3	12	3.50e-10	10	0	0

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	96.3	1	26	1	26	6.09e-30	26	0	0

Casein-derived antioxidant peptides by using microbial proteases have gained increasing attention. Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.	10.4014/jmb.2104.04013	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1	9	3	11	6.03e-09	9	0	0

DKIHPFA	P02666	DKIHPF	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	62-67	ACE-inhibitory		256.8				Production of Angiotensin-I-Converting-Enzyme-Inhibitory Peptides in Fermented Milks Started by Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus SS1 and Lactococcus lactis subsp cremoris FT4	Gobbetti, M. et al.	Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	2	10	1	9	1.29e-06	9	1	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	2	12	1	11	2.41e-11	11	0	0

In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased. The peptides not hydrolysed by gastrointestinal enzymes and peptide VRYL, which was only partly hydrolysed, were incubated with ACE and were found to be true inhibitors of the enzyme and to have a competitive inhibition pattern.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.04.007	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown.

EDVPSERY	O62823	EDVPSER	Alpha-S1-casein	Bubalus bubalis	99-105	Osteoanabolic						Effect of buffalo casein derived novel bioactive peptides on osteoblast differentiation	Reddi, S. et al.	Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.	10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0
EELNVPGEIVE	P02666	ELNVPGEIVES	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	20-30	Antimicrobial						Modulation of Virulence Gene Expression in Salmonella enterica subsp enterica typhimurium by Synthetic Milk-Derived Peptides	Ali, E. et al.	The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides. Depending on dose and amino acid sequence, these five peptides were able to affect the expression of some virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium.	10.1007/s12602-022-09936-2	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	2	11	1	10	3.98e-10	10	0	0

Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	3	11	1	9	7.37e-09	9	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

ELEELN	P02666	RELEEL	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	16-21	Antioxidant						Isolation of antioxidant peptides from yak casein	Liu, Q. et al.	Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein is a principal method to obtain antioxidant peptides. A yak casein hydrolysate (YCH) was prepared by alcalase and trypsin digestion. An ultrafiltration membrane system was used to divide the hydrolysate into four molecular weight fractions; YCH-4 (<3 kDa) had the highest antioxidant activity. Fraction YCH-4 was separated into six subfractions by gel filtration chromatography; reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was then used to partition sixteen antioxidant peptide subfractions. Liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was used to determine the amino acid sequence of a purified antioxidant peptide to be Arg-Glu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu (787.41 Da). Finally, a synthetic Arg-Glu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu peptide was evaluated for its superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.52 and 0.69 mg mL−1), which confirmed the activity of the native purified peptide. Our results suggested that isolation and purification of antioxidant peptides from yak casein could be an important means to obtain natural antioxidant peptides.	10.1039/D0RA02644A	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	5	2	6	6.95e-04	5	0	0

Inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV is one of the strategies used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, pepsin-treated whey protein isolate (WPI) and α-lactalbumin displaying DPP-IV inhibitory activity were fractionated by successive chromatographic steps and the resulting active fractions analyzed for their constituent peptides by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Among the identified sequences, 24 peptides derived from α-lactalbumin and 11 from β-lactoglobulin were synthesized and their effects on DPP-IV activity assessed. The most potent fragments, LKPTPEGDL and LKPTPEGDLEIL (IC50 = 45 and 57 μM, respectively), were found to inhibit DPP-IV in an un-competitive manner. Although several of the peptides tested showed some inhibitory activity, only two were as effective as the un-fractionated WPI hydrolysate and none were as potent as the un-fractionated α-lactalbumin hydrolysate. The peptides’ structural features, including length and amino acid composition, were found to impact their inhibitory activity.

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	2.43e-07	8	0	0

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	89.66	1	26	2	27	1.73e-29	26	0	0

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	6	1	6	1.71e-05	6	0	0

This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	6	1	6	1.71e-05	6	0	0
EMPFPK	P02666	EMPFPK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	123-128	Bradykinin-Potentiating						Biochemical and Pharmacological Aspects of Two Bradykinin-Potentiating Peptides Obtained from Tryptic Hydrolysis of Casein	Perpetuo, EA. et al.	Peptides that display bradykinin-potentiating activity have been obtained from a number of distinct sources, such as snake venoms, fibrinogen, and casein. This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108–113 and 114–121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response.	10.1023/b:jopc.0000008724.98339.ff	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	6	1	6	1.71e-05	6	0	0
EMPFPK	P02666	EMPFPK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	123-128	Increase mucin secretion	Increase MUC4 expression					β-Casein(94-123)-derived peptides differently modulate production of mucins in intestinal goblet cells	Plaisancie, P. et al.	We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	6	1	6	1.71e-05	6	0	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	2	10	1	9	6.94e-09	9	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation.

In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	6	1	6	1.71e-05	6	0	0

To obtain a bioactive peptide released from casein and investigate the cytomodulatory effect of this bioactive peptide, Lactobacillus helveticus CICC 22171, isolated from traditional Chinese dairy product, was directly used to hydrolyze casein (5 %) at 37 C for 48 h. Ultrafiltration, Sephadex column chromatography and high-speed counter-current chromatography were used to purify the peptide. After obtaining the peptide (named as β-Casobapt-ZW), a battery assays, including acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry analysis, were used to determine the cytomodulatory effect on Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells. The results showed that β-Casobapt-ZW could induce Caco-2 cell shrinkage, chromosome aggregation and apoptotic. The apoptotic rate could reach to 20.36 %. However, the effects were not obvious for IEC-6 cell, and the apoptotic rate was only 3.1 %. β-Casobapt-ZW showed obvious effect on inducing Caco-2 cells apoptosis and could not have significant influence on the growth of IEC-6 cells. The molecular weight of this peptide was about 1,020 Da, and the amino acid sequence was EPVLGPVRGP. It belonged to a fragment of β-casein (β-CN, f210–219).	10.1007/s00217-013-2106-7	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	1	8	1.04e-07	8	0	0

Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	10.3168/jds.2015-9569	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.04e-07	8	0	0

Various bioactive peptides are identified from casein hydrolysates. YQEPVLGPVR (PICA), a novel antithrombotic peptide derived from beta-casein (fragment 193-202), was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The anticoagulation activity assay showed that this peptide has a strong anticoagulant activity. It was proved that the peptide did not interact with the active site of thrombin to inhibit thrombin, and that it inhibited thrombin activity by binding the exosite-1 of thrombin, which was also confirmed by the fibrinogen clotting time assay. It was shown that PICA prolonged fibrinogen clotting time in a dose-dependent manner. Secondary structures of the thrombin-PICA complex were also measured by circular dichroism to prove that PICA can combine with thrombin. Moreover, Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software was used for molecular docking to provide the potential mechanism for the antithrombotic activity of the peptide. These results suggested that PICA probably can be used as an antithrombotic ingredient in the functional food industry.	10.1039/c8fo02235f	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.04e-07	8	0	0

It was proved that the peptide did not interact with the active site of thrombin to inhibit thrombin, and that it inhibited thrombin activity by binding the exosite-1 of thrombin, which was also confirmed by the fibrinogen clotting time assay. It was shown that PICA prolonged fibrinogen clotting time in a dose-dependent manner. Secondary structures of the thrombin-PICA complex were also measured by circular dichroism to prove that PICA can combine with thrombin. Moreover, Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software was used for molecular docking to provide the potential mechanism for the antithrombotic activity of the peptide. These results suggested that PICA probably can be used as an antithrombotic ingredient in the functional food industry.	10.1039/c8fo02235f	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	2.43e-07	8	0	0
EPVLGPVRGP	P02666	EPVLGPVRGP	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	210-219	Cytomodulatory						Characterization of a bioactive peptide with cytomodulatory effect released from casein	Zhao, HF. et al.	To obtain a bioactive peptide released from casein and investigate the cytomodulatory effect of this bioactive peptide, Lactobacillus helveticus CICC 22171, isolated from traditional Chinese dairy product, was directly used to hydrolyze casein (5 %) at 37 C for 48 h. Ultrafiltration, Sephadex column chromatography and high-speed counter-current chromatography were used to purify the peptide. After obtaining the peptide (named as β-Casobapt-ZW), a battery assays, including acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry analysis, were used to determine the cytomodulatory effect on Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells. The results showed that β-Casobapt-ZW could induce Caco-2 cell shrinkage, chromosome aggregation and apoptotic. The apoptotic rate could reach to 20.36 %. However, the effects were not obvious for IEC-6 cell, and the apoptotic rate was only 3.1 %. β-Casobapt-ZW showed obvious effect on inducing Caco-2 cells apoptosis and could not have significant influence on the growth of IEC-6 cells. The molecular weight of this peptide was about 1,020 Da, and the amino acid sequence was EPVLGPVRGP. It belonged to a fragment of β-casein (β-CN, f210–219).	10.1007/s00217-013-2106-7	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	10	1	10	1.88e-10	10	0	0

Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed. P17 showed high scavenging activity against 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals, with an IC50 of 29.88 μg mL−1, compared with P19 (IC50 1.44 mg mL−1). Furthermore, the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cell line was inhibited (41.49% and 38.55%, respectively, by P17 and P19 at 3 mg mL−1) via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of peptides resulted in increased bioactivities. These findings indicate a potential for utilising both of these peptides to manage oxidative stress mediated diseases and disorders including cancers.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.08.003	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	1	14	3	16	5.46e-15	14	0	0

Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and antithrombotic properties of peptides released from bovine caseins during fermentation by Lactobacillus casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus were determined. Both species released ACE inhibitory peptides, whereas only Lb. casei Shirota produced antithrombotic activity. The highest thrombin inhibitory activity, 80.7%, was observed at 27 h of fermentation by Lb. casei Shirota. Active peptides were purified by HPLC; seven peptides were obtained, and their resistance to digestive enzymes, pepsin and trypsin, was evaluated. The most active peptide even after the hydrolysis was identified as YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV (fragment 193–209 of β-casein): it had an inhibition efficiency ratio for ACE of 0.14%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1), and a thrombin inhibition efficiency ratio of 4.6%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1). This peptide had been previously reported as an ACE-inhibitor, but this is the first time that it is evaluated for its thrombin inhibition activity.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.05.002	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	1	14	3	16	5.46e-15	14	0	0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of a peptide derived from bovine beta-casein (beta-CN), the beta-CN (193-209) peptide, on mouse macrophages that were obtained either from germfree (GF) or from human flora-associated (HF) mice. Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.	10.1093/jn/131.11.2936 	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	1	14	3	16	5.46e-15	14	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0
ERYLGYLE	P02662	RYLGYLE	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-111	Antioxidant						In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Hydrolyzed infant formulas serve as appropriate nutritional sources for infants afflicted with cow’s milk allergy, and milk proteins in hydrolyzed formulas are industrially hydrolyzed extensively or partially. To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared. One standard, one extensively hydrolyzed, and one partially hydrolyzed infant formula were digested in vitro with pepsin and pancreatin, taking into account the higher gastric pH of infants, and the digesta were subjected to peptidomic analysis. The standard formula released a larger variety of bioactive peptides than from the hydrolyzed formulas, indicating that industrial hydrolysis of milk proteins may generally attenuate their indigenous bioactivities such as antibacterial, immuno-regulatory, and anti-oxidative activities. Conversely, industrial hydrolysis may facilitate the formation of bioactive peptides from hydrophobic proteins/regions such as β-LG and the “strategic zone” of β-CN, which encrypt bioactive peptides including a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4-inhibitory, hypocholesterolemic, and opioid peptides.

FLLYQEPVLGPVR	P02666	LYQEPVLGPVR	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	207-217	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Characterization of casein derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	3	13	1	11	2.41e-11	11	0	0

Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed. P17 showed high scavenging activity against 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals, with an IC50 of 29.88 μg mL−1, compared with P19 (IC50 1.44 mg mL−1). Furthermore, the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cell line was inhibited (41.49% and 38.55%, respectively, by P17 and P19 at 3 mg mL−1) via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of peptides resulted in increased bioactivities. These findings indicate a potential for utilising both of these peptides to manage oxidative stress mediated diseases and disorders including cancers.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.08.003	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	4	17	1	14	1.66e-14	14	0	0

Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and antithrombotic properties of peptides released from bovine caseins during fermentation by Lactobacillus casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus were determined. Both species released ACE inhibitory peptides, whereas only Lb. casei Shirota produced antithrombotic activity. The highest thrombin inhibitory activity, 80.7%, was observed at 27 h of fermentation by Lb. casei Shirota. Active peptides were purified by HPLC; seven peptides were obtained, and their resistance to digestive enzymes, pepsin and trypsin, was evaluated. The most active peptide even after the hydrolysis was identified as YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV (fragment 193–209 of β-casein): it had an inhibition efficiency ratio for ACE of 0.14%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1), and a thrombin inhibition efficiency ratio of 4.6%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1). This peptide had been previously reported as an ACE-inhibitor, but this is the first time that it is evaluated for its thrombin inhibition activity.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.05.002	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	4	17	1	14	1.66e-14	14	0	0

"Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control.

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	7	1	7	2.88e-04	7	1	0

Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.	10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	2	8	2.16e-06	7	0	0
FPGPIPNS	P02666	YPFPGPIPNS	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-84	Antianxiety						Release of an anti-anxiety peptide in casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease	Takeuchi, Y. et al.	Food protein-derived peptides with agonistic effects on receptors have great potential for treating anxiety, hypertension, and stress. In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for δ-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of β-casomorphin (CM-10) (β-casein 60–69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards δ- and μ-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for δ- and μ-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized δ-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of δ- or μ-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut δ- and/or μ-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.	10.1039/d2fo01793h	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.04e-07	8	0	0
FPGPIPNSLPQN	P33048	PFTGPIPNSLPQ	Beta-casein	Capra hircus	76-87	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	E. coli B. cereus		Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice	Almaas, H. et al.	Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	11	2	12	5.47e-09	11	1	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.04e-07	8	0	0

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.63e-07	8	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	9	1	9	3.24e-09	9	0	0

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	14	1	12	3.45e-12	12	0	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity	10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

Casein-derived antioxidant peptides by using microbial proteases have gained increasing attention. Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.	10.4014/jmb.2104.04013	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1	9	1	9	6.03e-09	9	0	0

Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested.

Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992 	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0
FTKKTKLTEEEKNRLN	P02663	TKKTKLTEEEKNRL	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	163-176	Antimicrobial			MIC	B. cereus S. aureus L. monocytogenes		Structure-activity relationships of as-casein peptides with multifunctional biological activities	Sistla, S. et al.	Multifunctional bioactive peptides have a wider role in modulating physiological functions and possess multiple biological activities. Peptides from bovine milk with sequences QKALNEINQF [p10] and TKKTKLTEEEKNRL [p14] from α-S2 casein f (79–88) and α-S2 casein f (148–161) were identified to be having multifunctional biological activities and were synthesized. These synthesized peptides show various biological activities like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, prolyl endopeptidase inhibition, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The mode of antimicrobial mechanism was studied and p10 shows depolarization of cell membrane, whereas p14 was found to display DNA-binding activity. Structural studies envisaged backbone flexibility, for differences in their mode of action. Peptide structure function studies were correlated to understand their multifunctional biological activity.	10.1007/s11010-013-1778-4	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	15	1	14	4.72e-15	14	0	0
FVAPFPE	P02662	VAPFPE	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	40-45	Cholesterol regulation	Inhibition of cholesterol solubility					Novel milk casein derived peptides decrease cholesterol micellar solubility and cholesterol intestinal absorption in Caco-2 cells	Jiang, X. et al.	This study sought to assess the cholesterol-lowering activity of peptides obtained from milk casein hydrolyzed with neutrase. The bioactive peptides were separated using a Sephadex G-10 chromatographic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) after ultrafiltration using a 1-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we determined that peptides Thr-Asp-Val-Glu-Asn [TDVEN; β-casein f(143–147)], Leu-Gln-Pro-Glu [LQPE; β-casein f(103–106)], Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu [VAPFPE; αS1-casein f(40–45)], and Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln [VLPVPQ β-casein f(185–190)] reduced micellar cholesterol solubility. After Caco-2 cells were treated with LQPE, VLPVPQ, and VAPFPE, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein levels decreased by (means ± SEM) 19.33 ± 2.47%, 52.1 ± 3.77%, and 23.09 ± 8.52%, respectively, compared with the control group. Treatment with each peptide induced significant upregulation of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8 antibody (ABCG8) mRNA expression by 398.1 ± 23.27%, 86.4 ± 27.07%, and 92.8 ± 8.49%. We found that VLPVPQ and LQPE significantly upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transcription by 203.9 ± 8.44% and 220.8 ± 36.42% respectively, whereas VLPVPQ significantly decreased mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) and microsomal triacylglycerols (MTP). The cholesterol-lowering action of milk-derived peptides may be induced by suppression of micellar cholesterol solubility and affects the expression of cholesterol absorption–related proteins and enzymes in intestinal epithelial cells. This research discovers new milk-derived peptides with decreasing cholesterol micellar solubility and provides a theoretical basis of in vitro cholesterol-lowering effects of peptides.	10.3168/jds.2019-17586	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	1	8	1.04e-07	8	0	0

The aim of the present work was to study the mode of the induction of the biosynthesis of macedocin, the lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Macedocin was produced when the strain was grown in milk but not in MRS or M17 broth. No autoinduction mechanism was observed. Production did not depend on the presence of lactose or galactose in the culture medium or on a coculture of the producer strain with macedocin-sensitive or macedocin-resistant strains. Induction seemed to depend on the presence of one or more heat-stable protein components produced when S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was grown in milk. The partial purification of the induction factor was performed by a combination of chromatography methods, and its activity was confirmed by a reverse transcription-PCR approach (RT-PCR). Mass spectrometric (MS) and tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analyses of an induction-active fraction showed the presence of several peptides of low molecular mass corresponding to fragments of αS1- and β-casein as well as β-lactoglobulin. The chemically synthesized αS1-casein fragment 37-55 (2,253.65 Da) was proven to be able to induce macedocin biosynthesis.

Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	91.67	1	11	2	12	2.30e-11	11	0	0

The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides. Depending on dose and amino acid sequence, these five peptides were able to affect the expression of some virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium.	10.1007/s12602-022-09936-2	sequence	IDENTITY	92.31	1	12	1	12	8.85e-13	12	0	0

Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.	10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.05.004	sequence	IDENTITY	86.67	1	26	1	26	1.49e-29	26	0	0

Scope

β-casofensin, also known as peptide β-CN(94-123), is a milk bioactive peptide that modulates the intestinal barrier through its action on goblet cells. Here, we evaluated whether oral administration of β-casofensin can prevent indomethacin-induced injury of the jejunum in rats.
Methods and results

Rats received β-casofensin (0.01–100 μM) or tap water by daily gavage (4 μL/g) for eight days, then two subcutaneous injections of indomethacin (10 mg/kg, days 9 and 10) and were euthanized on day 12. In vitro, we investigated the effects of β-casofensin on the restitution of a wounded monolayer. Preventive administration of β-casofensin (100 μM) reduced intestinal macroscopic and microscopic damage induced by indomethacin. β-casofensin also prevented the depletion of goblet cells and increased myeloperoxidase activity, as well as tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (TNF-ɑ) expression and immunostaining of active caspase-3 in the jejunum of rats treated with indomethacin. In wound healing experiments, β-casofensin promoted epithelial restitution with no effect on cell proliferation. This effect was inhibited by pre-incubation with an anti-CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) neutralizing antibody.
Conclusions

β-casofensin exerts protective effects in indomethacin-induced enteritis through preservation of goblet cells and improvement in wound healing. β-casofensin could therefore become vital in nutritional programs for the prevention of intestinal diseases."	10.1002/mnfr.201500680	sequence	IDENTITY	86.67	1	26	1	26	1.49e-29	26	0	0

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	1	9	2	10	4.50e-09	9	0	0

HKEMPFPKYP	P02666	HKEMPFPK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	121-128	Antimicrobial						Isolation and identification of some antibacterial peptides in the plasmin-digest of β-casein	Sedaghati, H. et al.	This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	16	1	16	1.44e-17	16	0	0

In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

HLPLPLL	P02666	LPLPLL	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	150-155	DPP-IV Inhibitory		371.5				Structure activity relationship modelling of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0
HPHPHLSF	P02668	RHPHPHLSFM	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	118-127	Antioxidant						 Insight into antioxidant properties of milk derived bioactive peptides in vitro and in a cellular model	Tonolo, F. et al.	Milk is a nutritionally important source of bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. These compounds can be useful as ingredients of functional food. For this reason, in the last decades, bioactive peptides attracted the interest of researchers and food companies. In this work, the results obtained with six milk-derived bioactive peptides (Y-4-R, V-6-R, V-7-K, A-10-F, R-10-M, and H-9-M) synthesized and studied for their antioxidant properties in vitro and in a cellular model, are reported. These molecules correspond to peptide fragments derived from parent compounds able to cross the apical membrane of Caco-2 cell layer and released in the basolateral compartment. In vitro, antioxidant tests such as 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and crocin bleaching showed antioxidant activity mainly for peptides Y-4-R and V-6-R, respectively. In Caco-2 cells, peptides V-6-R, H-9-R, Y-4-R, and particularly R-10-M and V-7-K are able to prevent the decrease of viability due to oxidative stress. The latter peptide is also the most effective in protecting cells from lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, the reported hydrolyzed peptides are shown to exert the antioxidant properties both in vitro and in a cellular model.	10.1002/psc.3162	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	2	9	1.04e-07	8	0	0

Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.	10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	8	1	8	5.62e-08	8	0	0

Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	10	3	12	3.50e-10	10	0	0

We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	94.12	1	16	1	16	1.13e-17	16	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

A series of separation methods including ultrafiltration, macroporous adsorption resin chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were applied to isolate and purify the peptide(s), which were mainly responsible for the activity. Finally, three novel growth-stimulating peptides, H-2-A, F2-c, and F2-b, corresponding to amino acid residues 29–35 and 103–108 of bovine αS2-casein and 181–186 of bovine αS1-casein, respectively, were obtained. With supplementation of H-2-A, F2-b, or F2-c at a protein concentration of 0.3%, the biomass yield of these two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was enhanced by 193.3, 166.7, or 151.7%, respectively. In addition, there were significant (p < 0.05) Increase in viable counts of St and lactic acid production of LAB in the presence of the purified peptides.	10.1021/jf200903u	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	2	9	1.04e-07	8	0	0

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	82.14	1	23	5	27	8.86e-26	23	0	0

In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

The aim of this work was to isolate and identify antibacterial peptides present in a pepsin digest of ovine αs2-casein. A protein digest with antibacterial properties was first separated by ion exchange chromatography. The fractions most active against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were fractionated by semi-preparative RP-HPLC, and the identification of the active peptides was carried out by on-line and off-line RP-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Following this strategy, 10 different peptides were identified, all corresponding to the C-terminal region of the ovine αs2-casein. Four of them were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, ovine αs2-casein f(165–181) exhibited the highest antibacterial potency against all bacteria tested. The antimicrobial activity was compared with that of other previously described peptides like lactoferricin and fragment f(183–207) of bovine αs2-casein.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.10.006	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox. From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively). The latter sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of the ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein molecule, also had antioxidant activity. The activity found is discussed in relation to the peptide sequences. 	10.1051/lait:2007019	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.	10.1002/biof.1023	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	10	1	10	3.50e-10	10	0	0

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

Food-derived bioactive peptides are considered as the important sources of natural bioactive ingredients. Approximately 3094 peptides were identified by nESI-LC–MS/MS in the hydrolyzed yak milk residue. Peptide KALNEINQF (T10) is the strongest antioxidant peptide. The damage model of H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was used to evaluate the antioxidant effect. After treatment with 25, 50, or 100 μg/mL T10 peptide, T10 obviously decreased H2O2-induced damage and increased the cell survival. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were significantly increased 1.03, 1.1, and 1.33 times, and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were significantly increased 1.11, 1.30, and 1.43 times, respectively. Malondialdehyde (MDA) also reduced 1.41, 1.54, and 1.72 times, respectively. T10 inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVECs, and protein expressions of the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2 and bax were increased and decreased by 1.95 and 1.44 times, respectively, suggesting T10 decreases apoptosis of the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, the RNA expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.00, 2.11, and 1.94 times; the protein expressions of p-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.67, 1.73, and 1.04 times; and Keap1 was downregulated by 3.9 and 1.32 times, respectively. T10 also regulated the Nrf2 pathway and expressions of related genes (Keap1, HO-1, and NQO1), and blocking the Nrf2 pathway in the model decreased the protective effect of T10. Taken together, T10 peptide isolated from yak milk residue has a protective effect against H2O2-induced damage in HUVECs and the molecular mechanisms are involved in the regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and cell apoptosis.	10.1155/2021/9426314	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	9	1	9	3.24e-09	9	0	0

Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.	10.1128/AEM.01394-13	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	1	12	1.57e-12	12	0	0

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

Epidemiological and intervention studies show that milk consumption in childhood and during adolescence is related to higher bone mineral density. Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate osteogenic nature of four novel bioactive peptides [PEP1 (EDVPSER), PEP2 (NAVPITPTL), PEP3 (VLPVPQK) and PEP4 (HPHPHLSF)] derived from buffalo casein by in vitro osteoblast differentiation model.	10.1007/s00394-016-1346-2	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0
KEMPFPK	P02666	EMPFPK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	123-128	Bradykinin-Potentiating						Biochemical and Pharmacological Aspects of Two Bradykinin-Potentiating Peptides Obtained from Tryptic Hydrolysis of Casein	Perpetuo, EA. et al.	Peptides that display bradykinin-potentiating activity have been obtained from a number of distinct sources, such as snake venoms, fibrinogen, and casein. This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108–113 and 114–121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response.	10.1023/b:jopc.0000008724.98339.ff	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	3	12	1	10	4.20e-10	10	0	0

For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased.

Template-based studies on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derivatives obtained through manipulation of the amino acid sequence are helpful to identify properties or residues that are important for biological activity. The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.	10.1128/AEM.01394-13	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	4	15	1.57e-12	12	0	0

This study evaluated four food-derived peptides with known antihypertensive activities for antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms, and assessed structure–function relationships using alanine analogues. The peptides (EVSLNSGYY, barley; PGTAVFK, soybean; TTMPLW, α-casein; VHLPP, α-zein) and the six alanine substitution peptides of PGTAVFK were synthesised, characterised and evaluated for antimicrobial activity using the bacteria, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus and the yeast, Candida albicans. The peptides TTMPLW and PGTAVFK inhibited growth of all four microorganisms tested, with activities of a similar order of magnitude to ampicillin and ethanol controls. EVSLNSGYY inhibited the growth of the bacteria, but VHLPP showed no antimicrobial activity. The alanine analogue, PGAAVFK showed the highest overall antimicrobial activity and PGTAVFA showed no activity; overall, the activities of the analogues were consistent with their structures. Some peptides with antihypertensive activity also show antimicrobial activity, suggesting that food-derived peptides may exert beneficial effects via a number of mechanisms.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.09.094	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not.

The antioxidant activity of caseins and casein-derived peptides was evaluated by using three free radical producing reactionsthe lipoxygenase- and AAPH-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.	10.1021/jf0003911	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	2	9	1	8	8.77e-08	8	0	0
KVLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antiapoptotic effect						 Anti-apoptotic effect of buffalo milk casein-derived bioactive peptide by directing Nrf2 regulation in starving fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Starvation conditions cause cell injury or ulcers from reactive oxygen species generation and, ultimately, lead to cell death or apoptosis. Milk has many bioactive peptides with cytoprotective potential. One such peptide is the buffalo milk β-casein derived antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. It was found to have cytoprotective action during oxidative stress. However, the protective role of the peptide in natural aging induced apoptosis has not been studied. In the present study, the anti-apoptotic effect of the peptide was analyzed by establishing an in vitro model of skin fibroblast cells with serum starved conditions similar to aging. Cell survivability and cytotoxicity were measured using MTT and LDH assays, respectively. Cell death rate was determined using propidium iodide staining. In addition, gene level expression of anti-apoptotic markers’ such as Nrf2, Keap-1, Bcl-2, Bax and HO-1 were analyzed using quantitative real time-PCR. While nuclear transmigration of Nrf2 at the protein level was analyzed using western blots. The peptide treatment led to inhibition of cell death as observed using PI, DCFH-DA staining and improvement in cell survival through the activation of transcription factor, Nrf2. The activation of Nrf2 stimulated the expression of cytoprotective signals from HO-1. Moreover, the peptide augmented the cellular protection by inhibiting the expression of the Nrf2 inhibitor (Keap1), pro-apoptotic markers (Bax) and stimulating anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) gene expression. In addition, a pronounced reduction in the activity of the cell injury marker, LDH was observed. Hence, this study showed that the antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK also showed an anti-apoptotic effect.	10.1016/j.fbio.2020.100566	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

KVLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Wound healing						Nrf2 dependent antiaging effect of milk derived bioactive peptide in old fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Prolonged passaging of primary fibroblast cells totally shapes the natural biological phenomena and leads to the appearance of features related to senescence. As a result, it is a good natural tool to delineate the molecular mechanism of cellular aging. The present investigation revealed the antiaging effect of milk-derived novel bioactive peptide (VLPVPQK). The peptide played an important role in downregulating apoptosis-related markers in late passages of cultured fibroblast cells. The peptide treatment to aged fibroblasts caused enhancement in cell migration, DNA integrity, and decrease in the lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide production as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, the peptide decreased the expression of apoptotic caspases, Bax, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) proteins. The peptide pretreatment also enhanced the extracellular collagen protein and antiapoptotic, Bcl-xL. In addition, the peptide treatment reversed the senescence-related activity in fibroblasts by stimulating Nrf2 mediated antioxidative defense system and inhibiting the action of NFkB/p38MAPK signaling, similar to the commercially available inhibitor (SB203580) of p38MAPK. Thus, the peptide exhibits the antiaging effect in dermal fibroblast cells.	10.1002/jcb.28246	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

This study sought to assess the cholesterol-lowering activity of peptides obtained from milk casein hydrolyzed with neutrase. The bioactive peptides were separated using a Sephadex G-10 chromatographic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) after ultrafiltration using a 1-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we determined that peptides Thr-Asp-Val-Glu-Asn [TDVEN; β-casein f(143–147)], Leu-Gln-Pro-Glu [LQPE; β-casein f(103–106)], Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu [VAPFPE; αS1-casein f(40–45)], and Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln [VLPVPQ β-casein f(185–190)] reduced micellar cholesterol solubility. After Caco-2 cells were treated with LQPE, VLPVPQ, and VAPFPE, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein levels decreased by (means ± SEM) 19.33 ± 2.47%, 52.1 ± 3.77%, and 23.09 ± 8.52%, respectively, compared with the control group. Treatment with each peptide induced significant upregulation of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8 antibody (ABCG8) mRNA expression by 398.1 ± 23.27%, 86.4 ± 27.07%, and 92.8 ± 8.49%. We found that VLPVPQ and LQPE significantly upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transcription by 203.9 ± 8.44% and 220.8 ± 36.42% respectively, whereas VLPVPQ significantly decreased mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) and microsomal triacylglycerols (MTP). The cholesterol-lowering action of milk-derived peptides may be induced by suppression of micellar cholesterol solubility and affects the expression of cholesterol absorption–related proteins and enzymes in intestinal epithelial cells. This research discovers new milk-derived peptides with decreasing cholesterol micellar solubility and provides a theoretical basis of in vitro cholesterol-lowering effects of peptides.	10.3168/jds.2019-17586	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0
KVLPVPQK	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antiapoptotic effect						 Anti-apoptotic effect of buffalo milk casein-derived bioactive peptide by directing Nrf2 regulation in starving fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Starvation conditions cause cell injury or ulcers from reactive oxygen species generation and, ultimately, lead to cell death or apoptosis. Milk has many bioactive peptides with cytoprotective potential. One such peptide is the buffalo milk β-casein derived antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. It was found to have cytoprotective action during oxidative stress. However, the protective role of the peptide in natural aging induced apoptosis has not been studied. In the present study, the anti-apoptotic effect of the peptide was analyzed by establishing an in vitro model of skin fibroblast cells with serum starved conditions similar to aging. Cell survivability and cytotoxicity were measured using MTT and LDH assays, respectively. Cell death rate was determined using propidium iodide staining. In addition, gene level expression of anti-apoptotic markers’ such as Nrf2, Keap-1, Bcl-2, Bax and HO-1 were analyzed using quantitative real time-PCR. While nuclear transmigration of Nrf2 at the protein level was analyzed using western blots. The peptide treatment led to inhibition of cell death as observed using PI, DCFH-DA staining and improvement in cell survival through the activation of transcription factor, Nrf2. The activation of Nrf2 stimulated the expression of cytoprotective signals from HO-1. Moreover, the peptide augmented the cellular protection by inhibiting the expression of the Nrf2 inhibitor (Keap1), pro-apoptotic markers (Bax) and stimulating anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) gene expression. In addition, a pronounced reduction in the activity of the cell injury marker, LDH was observed. Hence, this study showed that the antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK also showed an anti-apoptotic effect.	10.1016/j.fbio.2020.100566	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0
KVLPVPQK	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Wound healing						Nrf2 dependent antiaging effect of milk derived bioactive peptide in old fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Prolonged passaging of primary fibroblast cells totally shapes the natural biological phenomena and leads to the appearance of features related to senescence. As a result, it is a good natural tool to delineate the molecular mechanism of cellular aging. The present investigation revealed the antiaging effect of milk-derived novel bioactive peptide (VLPVPQK). The peptide played an important role in downregulating apoptosis-related markers in late passages of cultured fibroblast cells. The peptide treatment to aged fibroblasts caused enhancement in cell migration, DNA integrity, and decrease in the lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide production as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, the peptide decreased the expression of apoptotic caspases, Bax, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) proteins. The peptide pretreatment also enhanced the extracellular collagen protein and antiapoptotic, Bcl-xL. In addition, the peptide treatment reversed the senescence-related activity in fibroblasts by stimulating Nrf2 mediated antioxidative defense system and inhibiting the action of NFkB/p38MAPK signaling, similar to the commercially available inhibitor (SB203580) of p38MAPK. Thus, the peptide exhibits the antiaging effect in dermal fibroblast cells.	10.1002/jcb.28246	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

KVPQLEIVPNSAEERLH	P02662	YKVPQLEIVPNSAEER	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	119-134	Increase calcium uptake					1 phosphorylation	Bioactive Peptides Isolated from Casein Phosphopeptides Enhance Calcium and Magnesium Uptake in Caco-2 Cell Monolayers	Cao, Y. et al.	The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5. These results provide novel insight into the mineral transport activity of phosphopeptides obtained from casein.	10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05711	sequence	IDENTITY	88.24	1	15	2	16	3.84e-16	15	0	0
KYIPIQY	P02669	YIPIQY	Kappa-casein	Ovis aries	46-51	ACE-inhibitory		10.0				Identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides from ovine milk proteins by CE-MS and chromatographic techniques	Gomez-Ruiz, JA. et al.	In this report, we present the use of CE-MS as complement to RP separation for the identification of novel angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides from a complex milk protein hydrolysate. As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.	10.1002/elps.200700324	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW.

KYPVEPF	P02666	YPVEPF	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Antimicrobial						Two New Secreted Proteases Generate a Casein derived Antimicrobial Peptide in Bacillus cereus Food Born Isolate Leading to Bacterial Competition in Milk	Ouertani, A. et al.	Milk and dairy products harbor a wide variety of bacterial species that compete for both limited resources and space. Under these competitive conditions, bacteria develop specialized mechanisms to protect themselves during niche colonization and nutrient acquisition processes. The bacterial antagonism mechanisms include the production of antimicrobial agents or molecules that facilitate competitor dispersal. In the present work, a bacterial strain designated RC6 was isolated from Ricotta and identified as Bacillus cereus. It generates antimicrobial peptide (AMP) when grown in the presence of casein. The AMP was active against several species of Bacillus and Listeria monocytogenes. MALDI-TOF analysis of the RP-HPLC purified fractions and amino acid sequencing revealed a molecular mass of 751 Da comprised of a 6-residue sequence, YPVEPF. BLAST analysis showed that the AMP corresponds to the fractions 114–119 of bovine β-casein and represents the product of a specific proteolysis. Analysis of the purified proteolytic fractions from the B. cereus RC6 culture supernatant indicated that the presence of at least two different endoproteases is crucial for the generation of the AMP. Indeed, we were able to identify two new candidate endoproteases by means of genome sequencing and functional assignment using a 3D structural model and molecular docking of misannotated hypothetical proteins. In this light, the capacity of B. cereus RC6 to generate antimicrobial peptides from casein, through the production of extracellular enzymes, presents a new model of antagonistic competition leading to niche colonization. Hence, as a dairy product contaminant, this strategy may enable proteolytic B. cereus RC6 niche specialization in milk matrices.	10.3389/fmicb.2018.01148	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0
KYPVEPF	P02666	YPVEPF	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Antioxidant						In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	2	9	1	8	8.77e-08	8	0	0

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared.

LLQSWMHQPHQPLPPT	P02666	SWMHQPHQPLPPT	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	157-169	Antioxidant						Identification of New Peptides from Fermented Milk Showing Antioxidant Properties: Mechanism of Action	Tonolo, F. et al.	Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	81.25	4	16	1	13	1.14e-13	13	0	0

Various bioactive peptides are identified from casein hydrolysates. YQEPVLGPVR (PICA), a novel antithrombotic peptide derived from beta-casein (fragment 193-202), was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The anticoagulation activity assay showed that this peptide has a strong anticoagulant activity. It was proved that the peptide did not interact with the active site of thrombin to inhibit thrombin, and that it inhibited thrombin activity by binding the exosite-1 of thrombin, which was also confirmed by the fibrinogen clotting time assay. It was shown that PICA prolonged fibrinogen clotting time in a dose-dependent manner. Secondary structures of the thrombin-PICA complex were also measured by circular dichroism to prove that PICA can combine with thrombin. Moreover, Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software was used for molecular docking to provide the potential mechanism for the antithrombotic activity of the peptide. These results suggested that PICA probably can be used as an antithrombotic ingredient in the functional food industry.	10.1039/c8fo02235f	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	2.43e-07	8	0	0

Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase).

Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.	10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	12	1	12	1.39e-12	12	0	0

Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed. P17 showed high scavenging activity against 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals, with an IC50 of 29.88 μg mL−1, compared with P19 (IC50 1.44 mg mL−1). Furthermore, the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cell line was inhibited (41.49% and 38.55%, respectively, by P17 and P19 at 3 mg mL−1) via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of peptides resulted in increased bioactivities. These findings indicate a potential for utilising both of these peptides to manage oxidative stress mediated diseases and disorders including cancers.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.08.003	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	3	16	1	14	1.18e-14	14	0	0

Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and antithrombotic properties of peptides released from bovine caseins during fermentation by Lactobacillus casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus were determined. Both species released ACE inhibitory peptides, whereas only Lb. casei Shirota produced antithrombotic activity. The highest thrombin inhibitory activity, 80.7%, was observed at 27 h of fermentation by Lb. casei Shirota. Active peptides were purified by HPLC; seven peptides were obtained, and their resistance to digestive enzymes, pepsin and trypsin, was evaluated.

LLYQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-224	Antimicrobial			MIC	E. coli		Antimicrobial activity of two peptides casecidin 15 and 17, found naturally in bovine colostrum	Birkemo, GA. et al.	"Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum."	10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x	sequence	IDENTITY	89.47	3	19	1	17	9.55e-19	17	0	0

We have found that an enzyme-modified cheese (EMC) inhibited the permeation of allergens such as ovalbumin (OVA), using Caco-2 cells as an in vitro intestinal epithelial model. In addition, NPWDQ (Asn-Pro-Trp-Asp-Gln, aa 107-111 of αs2-casein) was isolated from EMC and identified as one of the responsible peptides for this inhibitory activity (Tanabe et al., J. Agric. Food Chem., (2007)). In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism by which NPWDQ inhibited allergen permeation in vitro, and also to evaluate the effects of EMC on allergen permeation in vivo. Intestinal permeability for both fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated dextran and horseradish peroxidase was decreased in Caco-2 cells by the addition of NPWDQ, indicating that NPWDQ might inhibit both paracellular and transcellular transports. Next, intestinal inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injections of indomethacin to rats. When OVA was injected into the jejunal and ileac loops of indomethacin-administered rats with and without NPWDQ, it was found that the addition of NPWDQ effectively diminished OVA permeation from both loops. Although the plasma OVA concentration of indomethacin-administered rats after oral OVA challenge was markedly elevated over that of normal rats, supplemental administration of EMC to the rats effectively suppressed OVA permeation. These results suggest that EMC is useful for the prevention of food allergy by inhibiting allergen permeation probably by enforcing the intestinal barrier.	10.1271/bbb.80042	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	6	1	5	5.00e-04	5	0	0

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

LNYYQQKPVA	P02668	YYQQKPVA	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	63-70	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	E. coli S. carnosus		Identification of antibacterial peptides from bovine kappa-casein	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	The objective of the present study was to identify antimicrobial peptides present in several digests of commercial caseins with gastric enzymes. The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992 	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0

Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.	10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	7	1	7	2.88e-04	7	1	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	4	18	1	15	7.32e-16	15	0	0

In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	80.95	4	20	1	17	1.83e-18	17	0	0

Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed. P17 showed high scavenging activity against 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals, with an IC50 of 29.88 μg mL−1, compared with P19 (IC50 1.44 mg mL−1). Furthermore, the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cell line was inhibited (41.49% and 38.55%, respectively, by P17 and P19 at 3 mg mL−1) via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of peptides resulted in increased bioactivities. These findings indicate a potential for utilising both of these peptides to manage oxidative stress mediated diseases and disorders including cancers.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.08.003	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1	18	2	19	1.50e-19	18	0	0

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity.

This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	12	2	13	1.20e-12	12	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	86.67	3	15	1	13	8.10e-14	13	0	0

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	4	15	1	12	1.96e-12	12	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides. Depending on dose and amino acid sequence, these five peptides were able to affect the expression of some virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium.	10.1007/s12602-022-09936-2	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	2	12	1	11	2.41e-11	11	0	0

All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	1	10	1	10	5.04e-08	10	1	0

The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides.

The aim of the present study was to investigate important factors contributing to the high oxidative stability of fish-oil-enriched yoghurt, with particular emphasis on the possible antioxidative effects of peptides released during yoghurt fermentation. Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067	sequence	IDENTITY	92.86	2	14	1	13	7.76e-14	13	0	0

Food protein-derived peptides with agonistic effects on receptors have great potential for treating anxiety, hypertension, and stress. In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for δ-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of β-casomorphin (CM-10) (β-casein 60–69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards δ- and μ-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for δ- and μ-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized δ-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of δ- or μ-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut δ- and/or μ-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.	10.1039/d2fo01793h	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	2.43e-07	8	0	0

Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase). Declined (p < 0.01) mRNA expression of a transcription factor (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor: Nrf-2) involved in redox signalling further established the protective effect of peptide against oxidative stress induced injury	10.1007/s10989-018-9708-7	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	2	11	1	10	2.87e-10	10	0	0

Various bioactive peptides are identified from casein hydrolysates. YQEPVLGPVR (PICA), a novel antithrombotic peptide derived from beta-casein (fragment 193-202), was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The anticoagulation activity assay showed that this peptide has a strong anticoagulant activity. It was proved that the peptide did not interact with the active site of thrombin to inhibit thrombin, and that it inhibited thrombin activity by binding the exosite-1 of thrombin, which was also confirmed by the fibrinogen clotting time assay. It was shown that PICA prolonged fibrinogen clotting time in a dose-dependent manner. Secondary structures of the thrombin-PICA complex were also measured by circular dichroism to prove that PICA can combine with thrombin. Moreover, Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software was used for molecular docking to provide the potential mechanism for the antithrombotic activity of the peptide. These results suggested that PICA probably can be used as an antithrombotic ingredient in the functional food industry.	10.1039/c8fo02235f	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	2	11	1	10	2.87e-10	10	0	0

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures.

Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed. P17 showed high scavenging activity against 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals, with an IC50 of 29.88 μg mL−1, compared with P19 (IC50 1.44 mg mL−1). Furthermore, the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cell line was inhibited (41.49% and 38.55%, respectively, by P17 and P19 at 3 mg mL−1) via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase.

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM.

MAIPPKKN	P02668	MAIPPKK	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	127-133	ACE-inhibitory						Vascular effects and antihypertensive properties of kappa-casein macropeptide	Miguel, M. et al.	The blood-pressure-lowering effect of bovine κ-casein macropeptide (CMP), previously reported to exhibit a modest angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro, was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The oral administration of CMP (150 mg kg−1) significantly reduced the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHR. The antihypertensive action was more pronounced when CMP was treated with trypsin. The sequence MAIPPKK, identified in the tryptic hydrolysate of bovine CMP, significantly reduced blood pressure at a dose of 10 mg kg−1. The CMP and its tryptic peptides induced relaxation of endothelium-intact aortic rings. The sequence MAIPPKK also evoked a significant relaxation effect; however, the shorter sequence MAIPPK and the strong ACE-inhibitory tripeptide IPP exhibited a vascular relaxing effect lower than 10%. The implications of vascular relaxing mechanisms, as well as the possibility that the tripeptide IPP is at least partially responsible for the antihypertensive effects of CMP, are discussed.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.009	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0
MAIPPKKN	P02668	MAIPPKK	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	127-133	Antithrombotic						Bioactive peptides released by in vitro digestion of standard and hydrolyzed infant formulas	Wada, Y. et al.	Hydrolyzed infant formulas serve as appropriate nutritional sources for infants afflicted with cow’s milk allergy, and milk proteins in hydrolyzed formulas are industrially hydrolyzed extensively or partially. To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared. One standard, one extensively hydrolyzed, and one partially hydrolyzed infant formula were digested in vitro with pepsin and pancreatin, taking into account the higher gastric pH of infants, and the digesta were subjected to peptidomic analysis. The standard formula released a larger variety of bioactive peptides than from the hydrolyzed formulas, indicating that industrial hydrolysis of milk proteins may generally attenuate their indigenous bioactivities such as antibacterial, immuno-regulatory, and anti-oxidative activities. Conversely, industrial hydrolysis may facilitate the formation of bioactive peptides from hydrophobic proteins/regions such as β-LG and the “strategic zone” of β-CN, which encrypt bioactive peptides including a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4-inhibitory, hypocholesterolemic, and opioid peptides. Infants fed hydrolyzed infant formulas may be influenced by milk protein-derived bioactive peptides in a manner different from those fed standard formula.	10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.005	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Caseinomacropeptide (CMP) is a 7-kDa phosphoglycopolypeptide released from κ-casein during milk digestion and in the cheesemaking process. The objective of the study was to analyze the effect of pepsin-treated CMP from cow and goat milk on the resistance of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus rhamnosus during acid stress. Bacterial cells in the exponential growth phase were suspended in acidified phosphate buffered saline with or without pepsin-treated CMP. Viability was determined during a 90-min incubation period. Pepsin-treated CMP exhibited bactericidal activity at pH 3.5 when added in a dose-dependent manner to E. coli, decreasing survival by more than 90% within 15 min at 0.25 mg/mL. At pH >4.5, the bactericidal activity disappeared, indicating that pepsin-treated CMP was efficient at low pH only. The effectiveness of pepsin-treated CMP at pH 3.5 was not affected by the presence of glycoconjugates linked to CMP or by the bovine or caprine origin of milk. In contrast, L. rhamnosus, a probiotic, was more resistant to acid stress when pepsin-treated bovine or caprine CMP was added to the media. Viability reached 50% after 60 min of incubation at pH 3 compared with 5% survival in the media without added pepsin-treated CMP. Neither glycosylation extent nor sequence variations between CMP from bovine milk and caprine milk affected the protective activity of hydrolyzed CMP toward L. rhamnosus. This suggests that encrypted bioactive peptides released by the pepsin treatment of CMP had an antibacterial effect on E. coli in acidic media, but improved the resistance of L. rhamnosus to acid stress. The peptide fragment accountable for bactericidal activity is the N-terminal region κ-casein f(106-124).	10.3168/jds.2010-4142	sequence	IDENTITY	84.21	1	16	1	16	1.91e-17	16	0	0

Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation.

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	1	11	3	13	3.10e-11	11	0	0

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	1	11	2	12	3.36e-11	11	0	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM.

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control.

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	10	1	10	1.88e-10	10	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated.

In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0
NIPPLTQ	P02666	IPPLTQT	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	89-95	DPP-IV Inhibitory		465.1				Structure activity relationship modelling of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	1	9	1	9	4.50e-09	9	0	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM.

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity.

In this study, sodium caseinate hydrolysates produced by papain with strong growth-stimulating activity for Streptococcus thermophilus (St) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb) were obtained. A series of separation methods including ultrafiltration, macroporous adsorption resin chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were applied to isolate and purify the peptide(s), which were mainly responsible for the activity. Finally, three novel growth-stimulating peptides, H-2-A, F2-c, and F2-b, corresponding to amino acid residues 29–35 and 103–108 of bovine αS2-casein and 181–186 of bovine αS1-casein, respectively, were obtained. With supplementation of H-2-A, F2-b, or F2-c at a protein concentration of 0.3%, the biomass yield of these two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) was enhanced by 193.3, 166.7, or 151.7%, respectively.

New dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV)-inhibitory peptides from trypsin/chymotrypsin-treated goat milk casein hydrolysates were isolated and identified by two-dimensional silica thin-layer chromatography (2D-TLC) combined to nano LC–MS/MS. 2D-TLC with chloroform/methanol/25% ammonia (2:2:1) and n-butanol/acetic acid/water (4:1:1) as the first- and second-dimension eluents, respectively, in analytical and semipreparative scales, was set up and verified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP–HPLC) to be feasible and efficient to separate the hydrolysates. Five new DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, four relatively large oligopeptides (MHQPPQPL, SPTVMFPPQSVL, VMFPPQSVL, and INNQFLPYPY), and AWPQYL were identified, and INNQFLPYPY showed a notable IC50 value of 40.08 μM as an uncompetitive inhibitor. Interactive effects on DPP-IV inhibition were also observed among separated fractions and pure synthetic peptide mixtures with concentration-dependent activity. The study gives new insights into goat casein hydrolysates with identified DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides efficiently isolated by 2D-TLC, which provides a simple and cost-efficient separation process and is compatible with liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) identification.	10.1021/acs.jafc.5b03062	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.04e-07	8	0	0

Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	8	2	9	7.79e-08	8	0	0

Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	1	8	1.04e-07	8	0	0

In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides. Depending on dose and amino acid sequence, these five peptides were able to affect the expression of some virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium.	10.1007/s12602-022-09936-2	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1	9	3	11	9.32e-09	9	0	0

Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	2	9	1.81e-07	8	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	10	1	10	1.88e-10	10	0	0

The objective of the present study was to identify antimicrobial peptides present in several digests of commercial caseins with gastric enzymes. The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992 	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	2	8	1	7	2.16e-06	7	0	0

An 8-AA (8mer) fragment (PFPEVFGK) of a known antihypertensive peptide derived from bovine αS1-casein (C12 antihypertensive peptide) was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods.	10.3168/jds.2015-10437	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	8	1	8	8.77e-08	8	0	0

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.85e-05	6	0	0

In the present study in vivo impact of consumption of β-casomorphins (BCM-7/5) was evaluated on immune response of murine gut. The peptides were given to mice through oral intubation at a dose of 7.5 × 10−8 mol/day/animal for 15 days. Oral administration of both peptides individually increased (p <0.01) phenotypic expression of inflammation associated molecules (MPO, MCP-1, IL-4 and histamine), humoral immune response (IgE, IgG, IgG1/IgG2a), infiltration of leucocytes in intestinal villi and mRNA expression of toll like receptors (TLR-2 and TLR-4) in mice gut. However, no changes in sIgA, IgA+ and goblet cell numbers were recorded. These results clearly indicate that consumption of β-casein derived peptides BCM-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in gut, most likely through Th2 pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.03.018	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.85e-05	6	0	0

Understanding the digestive behaviour and biological activities of dairy proteins may help to develop model dairy products with targeted health outcomes including increased satiety and healthy weight maintenance. Caseins and whey proteins constitute over 95% of milk proteins with consumption of these proteins associated with increased satiety and a decreased prevalence of metabolic disorders. To investigate the in vitro digestive behaviour and satiety of dairy proteins at the intestinal epithelium, the in vitro transport and hydrolysis of 500–2000 μM β-casomorphin-7 (YPFPGPI or β-CM7) and a β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) dipeptide (YL) was measured using Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on transwells as a model of the intestinal epithelium. Transport of YL was concentration dependent and ranged from 0.37–5.26 × 10−6 cm s−1, whereas transport of β-CM7 was only detected at 2000 μM and was significantly lower at 0.13 × 10−6 cm s−1. Rapid hydrolysis of β-CM7 in the apical chamber by the Caco-2 cells produced three peptide metabolites: YP, GPI and FPGPI. All of these metabolites were detected in the basolateral chamber after 30 min with both the YP and GPI peptides transporting at a higher rate than intact β-CM7. In vitro satiety was indicated by the secretion of cholecystokinin [26–33] (CCK-8) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-17–36NH2) in the STC-1 enteroendocrine cell model. CCK-8 secretion was highest in response to β-CM7 followed by the β-CM7 metabolite FPGPI. CCK-8 secretion however was not significantly stimulated by the tri- or dipeptides. Secretion of GLP-1 was not significantly stimulated by β-CM7 or YL. These in vitro results suggest that dairy peptide size enhances CCK-8 secretion, whilst limiting transport across Caco-2 monolayers.	10.1039/c4fo00164h	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.85e-05	6	0	0

Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.	10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	8	1	8	1.59e-05	8	1	0
PFPGPIHNS	P02666	YPFPGPIPNS	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-84	Antianxiety						Release of an anti-anxiety peptide in casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease	Takeuchi, Y. et al.	Food protein-derived peptides with agonistic effects on receptors have great potential for treating anxiety, hypertension, and stress. In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for δ-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of β-casomorphin (CM-10) (β-casein 60–69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards δ- and μ-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for δ- and μ-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized δ-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of δ- or μ-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut δ- and/or μ-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.	10.1039/d2fo01793h	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	9	2	10	1.16e-06	9	1	0

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	91.67	1	12	1	12	1.65e-10	12	1	0

Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.	10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	4	15	1.57e-12	12	0	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml.

These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	11	1	10	4.20e-10	10	0	0
PKHPIK	P02662	RPKHPIK	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	16-22	Antimicrobial						Antibacterial Activities of Peptides from the Water-Soluble Extracts of Italian Cheese Varieties	Rizzello, CG. et al.	Water-soluble extracts of 9 Italian cheese varieties that differed mainly for type of cheese milk, starter, technology, and time of ripening were fractionated by reversed-phase fast protein liquid chromatography, and the antimicrobial activity of each fraction was first assayed toward Lactobacillus sakei A15 by well-diffusion assay. Active fractions were further analyzed by HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization-ion trap mass spectrometry, and peptide sequences were identified by comparison with a proteomic database. Parmigiano Reggiano, Fossa, and Gorgonzola water-soluble extracts did not show antibacterial peptides. Fractions of Pecorino Romano, Canestrato Pugliese, Crescenza, and Caprino del Piemonte contained a mixture of peptides with a high degree of homology. Pasta filata cheeses (Caciocavallo and Mozzarella) also had antibacterial peptides. Peptides showed high levels of homology with N-terminal, C-terminal, or whole fragments of well known antimicrobial or multifunctional peptides reported in the literature: αS1-casokinin (e.g., sheep αS1-casein (CN) f22–30 of Pecorino Romano and cow αS1-CN f24–33 of Canestrato Pugliese); isracidin (e.g., sheep αS1-CN f10–21 of Pecorino Romano); kappacin and casoplatelin (e.g., cow κ-CN f106–115 of Canestrato Pugliese and Crescenza); and β-casomorphin-11 (e.g., goat β-CN f60–68 of Caprino del Piemonte). As shown by the broth microdilution technique, most of the water-soluble fractions had a large spectrum of inhibition (minimal inhibitory concentration of 20 to 200 μg/mL) toward gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species, including potentially pathogenic bacteria of clinical interest. Cheeses manufactured from different types of cheese milk (cow, sheep, and goat) have the potential to generate similar peptides with antimicrobial activity.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)72913-1	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	2.37e-05	6	0	0

Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	5	2	6	6.95e-04	5	0	0

Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119).

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	8	2	9	7.79e-08	8	0	0
PSERYLG	P04653	VPSERYL	Alpha-S1-casein	Ovis aries	101-107	ACE-inhibitory		249.5				Angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory activity of peptides isolated from Manchego cheese Stability under simulated gastrointestinal digestion	Gomez-Ruiz, JA. et al.	In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased. The peptides not hydrolysed by gastrointestinal enzymes and peptide VRYL, which was only partly hydrolysed, were incubated with ACE and were found to be true inhibitors of the enzyme and to have a competitive inhibition pattern.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.04.007	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.85e-05	6	0	0
PVEPFTE	P02666	YPVEPFTE	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-136	Bradykinin-Potentiating						Biochemical and Pharmacological Aspects of Two Bradykinin-Potentiating Peptides Obtained from Tryptic Hydrolysis of Casein	Perpetuo, EA. et al.	Peptides that display bradykinin-potentiating activity have been obtained from a number of distinct sources, such as snake venoms, fibrinogen, and casein. This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108–113 and 114–121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response.	10.1023/b:jopc.0000008724.98339.ff	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	2	8	1.36e-06	7	0	0

To obtain a bioactive peptide released from casein and investigate the cytomodulatory effect of this bioactive peptide, Lactobacillus helveticus CICC 22171, isolated from traditional Chinese dairy product, was directly used to hydrolyze casein (5 %) at 37 C for 48 h. Ultrafiltration, Sephadex column chromatography and high-speed counter-current chromatography were used to purify the peptide. After obtaining the peptide (named as β-Casobapt-ZW), a battery assays, including acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry analysis, were used to determine the cytomodulatory effect on Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells. The results showed that β-Casobapt-ZW could induce Caco-2 cell shrinkage, chromosome aggregation and apoptotic. The apoptotic rate could reach to 20.36 %. However, the effects were not obvious for IEC-6 cell, and the apoptotic rate was only 3.1 %. β-Casobapt-ZW showed obvious effect on inducing Caco-2 cells apoptosis and could not have significant influence on the growth of IEC-6 cells. The molecular weight of this peptide was about 1,020 Da, and the amino acid sequence was EPVLGPVRGP.

PVLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-224	Anticancer						Antioxidant peptides isolated from synbiotic yoghurt exhibit antiproliferative activities against HT-29 colon cancer cells	B.N.P. Sah. et al.	Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed. P17 showed high scavenging activity against 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) radicals, with an IC50 of 29.88 μg mL−1, compared with P19 (IC50 1.44 mg mL−1). Furthermore, the proliferation of HT-29 colon cancer cell line was inhibited (41.49% and 38.55%, respectively, by P17 and P19 at 3 mg mL−1) via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G2/M-phase. In vitro gastrointestinal digestion of peptides resulted in increased bioactivities. These findings indicate a potential for utilising both of these peptides to manage oxidative stress mediated diseases and disorders including cancers.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.08.003	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	1	14	4	17	5.46e-15	14	0	0
PVLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-224	Antithrombotic						Antithrombotic and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory properties of peptides released from bovine casein by Lactobacillus casei Shirota	Rojas-Ronquillo, R. et al.	Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and antithrombotic properties of peptides released from bovine caseins during fermentation by Lactobacillus casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus were determined. Both species released ACE inhibitory peptides, whereas only Lb. casei Shirota produced antithrombotic activity. The highest thrombin inhibitory activity, 80.7%, was observed at 27 h of fermentation by Lb. casei Shirota. Active peptides were purified by HPLC; seven peptides were obtained, and their resistance to digestive enzymes, pepsin and trypsin, was evaluated. The most active peptide even after the hydrolysis was identified as YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV (fragment 193–209 of β-casein): it had an inhibition efficiency ratio for ACE of 0.14%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1), and a thrombin inhibition efficiency ratio of 4.6%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1). This peptide had been previously reported as an ACE-inhibitor, but this is the first time that it is evaluated for its thrombin inhibition activity.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.05.002	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	1	14	4	17	5.46e-15	14	0	0

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of a peptide derived from bovine beta-casein (beta-CN), the beta-CN (193-209) peptide, on mouse macrophages that were obtained either from germfree (GF) or from human flora-associated (HF) mice. Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.	10.1093/jn/131.11.2936 	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	1	14	4	17	5.46e-15	14	0	0
PVVVPPFL	A0A344X7B9	TPVVVPPFL	Beta-casein	Bos mutus	130-138	Anticancer						Preparation and identification of anti-breast cancer cells peptides released from yak milk casein	Gu, H. et al.	Yak milk casein (YMC) is the main protein in the yak milk. Peptides released from Yak milk casein (YMC) have multiple bioactivities, including anti-inflammation and immune-regulation, suggesting that these peptides might be able to inhibit cancer theoretically. However, the anti-cancer peptides from YMC have only been sparsely studied. Breast carcinoma is the most common carcinoma in women worldwide. Thus, the paper herein was to identify yak milk casein (YMC)-derived anti-breast cancer peptides via gel filtration, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) for the first time. The inhibitory effects of the hydrolysates on the cell viabilities, cell cycles and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were evaluated with a cck8 kit and a flow cytometry. The result showed that YMC hydrolysates (YMCH) obtained by united hydrolyzation with trypsin (3 h) and alkaline protease (3 h) displayed the highest cell viability inhibition rate for MCF7 (20.74 ± 1.39%) and MDA-MB-231 (26.73 ± 2.87%) cells. Three peptides were identified in the RP-HPLC subfraction F3-4, and a nonapeptide (TPVVVPPFL) showed the most potent inhibitory effects on both cancer cells and displayed good gastrointestinal stability. TPVVVPPFL could induce G2-M cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells and S cell arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis in both cancer cells. Moreover, in silico analysis indicated that the peptide had non-toxic and no inhibitory roles on P4502D6-enzyme. Together, this study shows that YMC is a good source of anti-breast cancer cells peptides.	10.3389/fnut.2022.997514	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	8	2	9	7.79e-08	8	0	0

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	1	10	1	10	2.61e-10	10	0	0

Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3	sequence	IDENTITY	90.91	1	10	2	11	2.61e-10	10	0	0

Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase).

Various bioactive peptides are identified from casein hydrolysates. YQEPVLGPVR (PICA), a novel antithrombotic peptide derived from beta-casein (fragment 193-202), was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The anticoagulation activity assay showed that this peptide has a strong anticoagulant activity. It was proved that the peptide did not interact with the active site of thrombin to inhibit thrombin, and that it inhibited thrombin activity by binding the exosite-1 of thrombin, which was also confirmed by the fibrinogen clotting time assay. It was shown that PICA prolonged fibrinogen clotting time in a dose-dependent manner. Secondary structures of the thrombin-PICA complex were also measured by circular dichroism to prove that PICA can combine with thrombin. Moreover, Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software was used for molecular docking to provide the potential mechanism for the antithrombotic activity of the peptide. These results suggested that PICA probably can be used as an antithrombotic ingredient in the functional food industry.	10.1039/c8fo02235f	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	1	9	2	10	4.50e-09	9	0	0

Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed.

Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and antithrombotic properties of peptides released from bovine caseins during fermentation by Lactobacillus casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus were determined. Both species released ACE inhibitory peptides, whereas only Lb. casei Shirota produced antithrombotic activity.

Active peptides were purified by HPLC; seven peptides were obtained, and their resistance to digestive enzymes, pepsin and trypsin, was evaluated. The most active peptide even after the hydrolysis was identified as YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV (fragment 193–209 of β-casein): it had an inhibition efficiency ratio for ACE of 0.14%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1), and a thrombin inhibition efficiency ratio of 4.6%/peptide concentration (μg mL−1).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of a peptide derived from bovine beta-casein (beta-CN), the beta-CN (193-209) peptide, on mouse macrophages that were obtained either from germfree (GF) or from human flora-associated (HF) mice. Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.	10.1093/jn/131.11.2936 	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	1	14	2	15	5.46e-15	14	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	4	15	1.57e-12	12	0	0
QKALNEINQF	E9NZN2	KALNEINQF	Alpha-S2-casein	Bubalus bubalis	95-103	Antioxidant						Peptides  Isolated  from  Yak  Milk  Residue  Exert  Antioxidant  Effects  through  Nrf2  Signal  Pathway	Yang, F.  et al.	Food-derived bioactive peptides are considered as the important sources of natural bioactive ingredients. Approximately 3094 peptides were identified by nESI-LC–MS/MS in the hydrolyzed yak milk residue. Peptide KALNEINQF (T10) is the strongest antioxidant peptide. The damage model of H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was used to evaluate the antioxidant effect. After treatment with 25, 50, or 100 μg/mL T10 peptide, T10 obviously decreased H2O2-induced damage and increased the cell survival. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were significantly increased 1.03, 1.1, and 1.33 times, and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were significantly increased 1.11, 1.30, and 1.43 times, respectively. Malondialdehyde (MDA) also reduced 1.41, 1.54, and 1.72 times, respectively. T10 inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVECs, and protein expressions of the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2 and bax were increased and decreased by 1.95 and 1.44 times, respectively, suggesting T10 decreases apoptosis of the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, the RNA expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.00, 2.11, and 1.94 times; the protein expressions of p-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.67, 1.73, and 1.04 times; and Keap1 was downregulated by 3.9 and 1.32 times, respectively. T10 also regulated the Nrf2 pathway and expressions of related genes (Keap1, HO-1, and NQO1), and blocking the Nrf2 pathway in the model decreased the protective effect of T10. Taken together, T10 peptide isolated from yak milk residue has a protective effect against H2O2-induced damage in HUVECs and the molecular mechanisms are involved in the regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and cell apoptosis.	10.1155/2021/9426314	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	2	10	1	9	5.00e-09	9	0	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of a tryptic digest of bovine αS2-casein (αS2-CN) was extensively investigated. Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity	10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	1.81e-07	8	0	0

Multifunctional bioactive peptides have a wider role in modulating physiological functions and possess multiple biological activities. Peptides from bovine milk with sequences QKALNEINQF [p10] and TKKTKLTEEEKNRL [p14] from α-S2 casein f (79–88) and α-S2 casein f (148–161) were identified to be having multifunctional biological activities and were synthesized. These synthesized peptides show various biological activities like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, prolyl endopeptidase inhibition, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The mode of antimicrobial mechanism was studied and p10 shows depolarization of cell membrane, whereas p14 was found to display DNA-binding activity. Structural studies envisaged backbone flexibility, for differences in their mode of action. Peptide structure function studies were correlated to understand their multifunctional biological activity.	10.1007/s11010-013-1778-4	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	10	1	10	1.88e-10	10	0	0
QKAMKPWIQPK	P02663	AMKPWIQPK	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	204-212	ACE-inhibitory		600.0				Identification of an Antihypertensive Peptide from Casein Hydrolysate Produced by a Proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790	Maeno, M. et al.	Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	3	11	1	9	7.37e-09	9	0	0
QKFPQYLQ	P02663	YQKFPQYLQY	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	104-113	ACE-inhibitory						Identification and characterization of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory peptide derived from bovine casein	Xue, L. et al.	In this study, we identified a novel angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide, YQKFPQYLQY (YQK), derived from bovine casein. Casein was hydrolyzed using pepsin and trypsin. The target peptide, YQK, was separated from the hydrolysate by ultrafiltration and Sephadex G-15chromatography. The IC50 value of YQK was 11.1 μM. YQK retained its ACE inhibitory activity under various temperature and pH conditions. It was also stable against the digestive enzymes pepsin and trypsin. The Lineweaver–Burk plot suggested that the inhibitory mode of YQK was competitive. Furthermore, its antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) also revealed that oral administration of YQK can significantly decrease systolic blood pressure. These results suggested that YQK may have potential applications in functional foods or pharmaceuticals as an antihypertensive agent.	10.1016/j.peptides.2017.09.021	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	2	9	1.04e-07	8	0	0

Milk whey and casein proteins were fermented with different lactic acid starters and digestive enzymes. ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.	10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0

Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	2	10	1	9	6.94e-09	9	0	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	88.24	2	16	1	15	3.61e-16	15	0	0

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures.

These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	93.75	1	15	2	16	2.66e-16	15	0	0

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	4	15	1	12	1.96e-12	12	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5. These results provide novel insight into the mineral transport activity of phosphopeptides obtained from casein.	10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05711	sequence	IDENTITY	95.0	1	19	2	20	3.24e-21	19	0	0

Tonolo, F. et al.	Redox status and inflammation are related to the pathogenesis of the majority of diseases. Therefore, understanding the role of specific food-derived molecules in the regulation of their specific pathways is a relevant issue. Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-α, the levels of NF-κB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-α alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-α) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.	10.3390/ijms23084382	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	94.12	1	16	2	17	1.06e-17	16	0	0

This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	81.25	4	16	1	13	1.58e-13	13	0	0

Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant.

No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown.

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG.

QTPVVVPPF	A0A344X7B9	TPVVVPPFL	Beta-casein	Bos mutus	130-138	Anticancer						Preparation and identification of anti-breast cancer cells peptides released from yak milk casein	Gu, H. et al.	Yak milk casein (YMC) is the main protein in the yak milk. Peptides released from Yak milk casein (YMC) have multiple bioactivities, including anti-inflammation and immune-regulation, suggesting that these peptides might be able to inhibit cancer theoretically. However, the anti-cancer peptides from YMC have only been sparsely studied. Breast carcinoma is the most common carcinoma in women worldwide. Thus, the paper herein was to identify yak milk casein (YMC)-derived anti-breast cancer peptides via gel filtration, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) for the first time. The inhibitory effects of the hydrolysates on the cell viabilities, cell cycles and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were evaluated with a cck8 kit and a flow cytometry. The result showed that YMC hydrolysates (YMCH) obtained by united hydrolyzation with trypsin (3 h) and alkaline protease (3 h) displayed the highest cell viability inhibition rate for MCF7 (20.74 ± 1.39%) and MDA-MB-231 (26.73 ± 2.87%) cells. Three peptides were identified in the RP-HPLC subfraction F3-4, and a nonapeptide (TPVVVPPFL) showed the most potent inhibitory effects on both cancer cells and displayed good gastrointestinal stability. TPVVVPPFL could induce G2-M cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells and S cell arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis in both cancer cells. Moreover, in silico analysis indicated that the peptide had non-toxic and no inhibitory roles on P4502D6-enzyme. Together, this study shows that YMC is a good source of anti-breast cancer cells peptides.	10.3389/fnut.2022.997514	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	2	9	1	8	1.22e-07	8	0	0

Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	2	10	1	9	9.32e-09	9	0	0

The aim of the present study was to investigate important factors contributing to the high oxidative stability of fish-oil-enriched yoghurt, with particular emphasis on the possible antioxidative effects of peptides released during yoghurt fermentation. Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	12	2	13	1.20e-12	12	0	0

On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067	sequence	IDENTITY	92.86	1	13	2	14	7.76e-14	13	0	0

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight.

RELEELN	P02666	RELEEL	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	16-21	Antioxidant						Isolation of antioxidant peptides from yak casein	Liu, Q. et al.	Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein is a principal method to obtain antioxidant peptides. A yak casein hydrolysate (YCH) was prepared by alcalase and trypsin digestion. An ultrafiltration membrane system was used to divide the hydrolysate into four molecular weight fractions; YCH-4 (<3 kDa) had the highest antioxidant activity. Fraction YCH-4 was separated into six subfractions by gel filtration chromatography; reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was then used to partition sixteen antioxidant peptide subfractions. Liquid chromatography/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was used to determine the amino acid sequence of a purified antioxidant peptide to be Arg-Glu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu (787.41 Da). Finally, a synthetic Arg-Glu-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu peptide was evaluated for its superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.52 and 0.69 mg mL−1), which confirmed the activity of the native purified peptide. Our results suggested that isolation and purification of antioxidant peptides from yak casein could be an important means to obtain natural antioxidant peptides.	10.1039/D0RA02644A	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.	10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1	9	1	9	7.37e-09	9	0	0

Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified was casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of αs1-casein. This product consisted of the N-terminal segment (1–23) of αs1-casein B, named ‘isracidin’, and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest, in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source.	10.1016/0278-6915(95)00097-6	sequence	IDENTITY	82.61	1	19	1	19	5.28e-21	19	0	0

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0
RYLGYLEQ	P02662	RYLGYLE	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-111	Antioxidant						In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Hydrolyzed infant formulas serve as appropriate nutritional sources for infants afflicted with cow’s milk allergy, and milk proteins in hydrolyzed formulas are industrially hydrolyzed extensively or partially. To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared. One standard, one extensively hydrolyzed, and one partially hydrolyzed infant formula were digested in vitro with pepsin and pancreatin, taking into account the higher gastric pH of infants, and the digesta were subjected to peptidomic analysis. The standard formula released a larger variety of bioactive peptides than from the hydrolyzed formulas, indicating that industrial hydrolysis of milk proteins may generally attenuate their indigenous bioactivities such as antibacterial, immuno-regulatory, and anti-oxidative activities. Conversely, industrial hydrolysis may facilitate the formation of bioactive peptides from hydrophobic proteins/regions such as β-LG and the “strategic zone” of β-CN, which encrypt bioactive peptides including a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4-inhibitory, hypocholesterolemic, and opioid peptides.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects."	10.1002/mnfr.201500182	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	3	11	1	9	1.02e-08	9	0	0

Casein-derived antioxidant peptides by using microbial proteases have gained increasing attention. Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.	10.4014/jmb.2104.04013	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	1	11	2	12	3.36e-11	11	0	0

Proteolytic digestion of bovine β-lactoglobulin by trypsin yielded four peptide fragments with bactericidal activity. The peptides were isolated and their sequences were found as follows: VAGTWY (residues 15–20), AASDISLLDAQSAPLR (residues 25–40), IPAVFK (residues 78–83) and VLVLDTDYK (residues 92–100). The four peptides were synthesized and found to exert bactericidal effects against the Gram-positive bacteria only. In order to understand the structural requirements for antibacterial activity, the amino acid sequence of the peptide VLVLDTDYK was modified. The replacement of the Asp (98) residue by Arg and the addition of a Lys residue at the C-terminus yielded the peptide VLVLDTRYKK which enlarged the bactericidal activity spectrum to the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Bordetella bronchiseptica and significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide toward Bacillus subtilis. By data base searches with the sequence VLVLDTRYKK a high homology was found with the peptide VLVATLRYKK (residues 55–64) of human blue-sensitive opsin, the protein of the blue pigment responsible for color vision. A peptide with this sequence was synthesized and assayed for bactericidal activity. VLVATLRYKK was strongly active against all the bacterial strains tested. Our results suggest a possible antimicrobial function of β-lactoglobulin after its partial digestion by endopeptidases of the pancreas and show moreover that small targeted modifications in the sequence of β-lactoglobulin could be useful to increase its antimicrobial function.	10.1016/s0304-4165(01)00116-7	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	14	3	16	4.13e-15	14	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities.

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5. These results provide novel insight into the mineral transport activity of phosphopeptides obtained from casein.	10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05711	sequence	IDENTITY	81.25	3	15	1	13	2.01e-13	13	0	0

SKVLPVPQKA	P02666	KVLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	184-191	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Nrf2-Activating  Bioactive  Peptides  Exert  Anti-Inflammatory  Activity  through  Inhibition  of  the  NF-kappa  B  Pathway.  	Tonolo, F. et al.	Redox status and inflammation are related to the pathogenesis of the majority of diseases. Therefore, understanding the role of specific food-derived molecules in the regulation of their specific pathways is a relevant issue. Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-α, the levels of NF-κB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-α alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-α) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.	10.3390/ijms23084382	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	2	9	1	8	1.30e-07	8	0	0
SKVLPVPQKAVPYPQ	P02666	SQSKVLPVPQKAVPYPQ	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	181-197	Antioxidant						Identification of New Peptides from Fermented Milk Showing Antioxidant Properties: Mechanism of Action	Tonolo, F. et al.	Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	88.24	1	15	3	17	2.44e-16	15	0	0

This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	86.67	3	15	1	13	1.13e-13	13	0	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	5	20	1	16	4.32e-17	16	0	0

This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.	10.1128/AEM.00096-07	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	3	12	1	10	4.20e-10	10	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated.

Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	89.47	3	19	1	17	9.55e-19	17	0	0

Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	91.67	2	12	1	11	2.30e-11	11	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control.

The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	9	2	10	1.16e-06	9	1	0

The hydrolysis of milk proteins produces valuable bioactive peptides, some of which show antivirulence activity. In this study, five synthetic milk-derived peptides (β-LG f(9–18), β-CN f(5–15), β-CN f(17–27), β-CN f(94–106), and β-CN f(129–137)) were shown to decrease the expression of virulence genes in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica typhimurium when tested at four concentrations (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/ml). A mixture of these synthetic peptides at concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/ml each significantly downregulated the expression of both hilA and ssrB virulence genes in Salmonella typhimurium after a 3-h incubation. Individually, β-CN f(17–27) at 0.02 mg/ml caused a significant decrease in both hilA and ssrB gene expressions. These results suggest a synergistic interaction between bioactive peptides.

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	3	11	1	9	1.38e-08	9	0	0

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	91.67	1	11	1	11	1.52e-11	11	0	0

Peptides from bovine milk with sequences QKALNEINQF [p10] and TKKTKLTEEEKNRL [p14] from α-S2 casein f (79–88) and α-S2 casein f (148–161) were identified to be having multifunctional biological activities and were synthesized. These synthesized peptides show various biological activities like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, prolyl endopeptidase inhibition, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The mode of antimicrobial mechanism was studied and p10 shows depolarization of cell membrane, whereas p14 was found to display DNA-binding activity. Structural studies envisaged backbone flexibility, for differences in their mode of action.

Template-based studies on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derivatives obtained through manipulation of the amino acid sequence are helpful to identify properties or residues that are important for biological activity. The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.	10.1128/AEM.01394-13	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	1	8	1.04e-07	8	0	0

TKVIPYVRYL	P02663	TKVIPYVRYL	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	213-222	Antimicrobial			MIC	C. sakazakii L. monocytogenes		Structure-activity relationship of synthetic variants of the milk-derived antimicrobial peptide αs2-casein f(183-207)	Alvarez-Ordonez, A. et al.	Template-based studies on antimicrobial peptide (AMP) derivatives obtained through manipulation of the amino acid sequence are helpful to identify properties or residues that are important for biological activity. The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.	10.1128/AEM.01394-13	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	10	1	10	1.88e-10	10	0	0
TLTDVENLHLP	P05814	LTDLENLHLP	Beta-casein	Homo sapiens	133-142	ACE-inhibitory						Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme by synthetic peptides of human β-casein	Kohmura, M. et al.	The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.	10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	2	11	1	10	7.29e-08	10	1	0

Ultrafiltration permeate of whey protein tryptic hydrolyzate was processed by nanofiltration (NF) to obtain retentate (NFR) and permeate (NFP) that were then tested as inhibitors of Listeria, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. NFR at 20 mg mL−1 was most effective as an inhibitor (P < 0.001); whereas E. coli was relatively resistant, the effect on Listeria and S. aureus was greater at 20 mg mL−1 than at 10 mg mL−1 (P < 0.01). Peptide analysis revealed that NFR was rich in anionic peptides over eight amino acid residues in length. The antibacterial activity of two anionic peptides (84–91 and 125–135) and a cationic peptide (36–42) derived from β-lactoglobulin was tested. Peptide 125–135 was more inhibitory (P < 0.05) than peptide 84–91 against Listeria monocytogenes and S. aureus; peptide 36–42 was not inhibitory. NFR appears to have potential as a natural bio-preservative.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.09.003	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	1	11	1	11	2.41e-11	11	0	0

Yak milk casein (YMC) is the main protein in the yak milk. Peptides released from Yak milk casein (YMC) have multiple bioactivities, including anti-inflammation and immune-regulation, suggesting that these peptides might be able to inhibit cancer theoretically. However, the anti-cancer peptides from YMC have only been sparsely studied. Breast carcinoma is the most common carcinoma in women worldwide. Thus, the paper herein was to identify yak milk casein (YMC)-derived anti-breast cancer peptides via gel filtration, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) for the first time. The inhibitory effects of the hydrolysates on the cell viabilities, cell cycles and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were evaluated with a cck8 kit and a flow cytometry. The result showed that YMC hydrolysates (YMCH) obtained by united hydrolyzation with trypsin (3 h) and alkaline protease (3 h) displayed the highest cell viability inhibition rate for MCF7 (20.74 ± 1.39%) and MDA-MB-231 (26.73 ± 2.87%) cells. Three peptides were identified in the RP-HPLC subfraction F3-4, and a nonapeptide (TPVVVPPFL) showed the most potent inhibitory effects on both cancer cells and displayed good gastrointestinal stability. TPVVVPPFL could induce G2-M cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells and S cell arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis in both cancer cells. Moreover, in silico analysis indicated that the peptide had non-toxic and no inhibitory roles on P4502D6-enzyme. Together, this study shows that YMC is a good source of anti-breast cancer cells peptides.	10.3389/fnut.2022.997514	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	8	1	8	7.79e-08	8	0	0

Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats.

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	2	10	1	9	9.32e-09	9	0	0

The aim of the present study was to investigate important factors contributing to the high oxidative stability of fish-oil-enriched yoghurt, with particular emphasis on the possible antioxidative effects of peptides released during yoghurt fermentation. Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	12	3	14	1.20e-12	12	0	0

The aim of the present study was to investigate important factors contributing to the high oxidative stability of fish-oil-enriched yoghurt, with particular emphasis on the possible antioxidative effects of peptides released during yoghurt fermentation. Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt.

TPVVVPPFLQPEV	P33048	PVVVPPFLQPE	Beta-casein	Capra hircus	96-106	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	E. coli		Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice	Almaas, H. et al.	Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	2	12	1	11	2.41e-11	11	0	0

Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	1	11	1	11	2.41e-11	11	0	0

Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.	10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	4	15	1	12	4.87e-12	12	0	0

Yak milk casein (YMC) is the main protein in the yak milk. Peptides released from Yak milk casein (YMC) have multiple bioactivities, including anti-inflammation and immune-regulation, suggesting that these peptides might be able to inhibit cancer theoretically. However, the anti-cancer peptides from YMC have only been sparsely studied. Breast carcinoma is the most common carcinoma in women worldwide. Thus, the paper herein was to identify yak milk casein (YMC)-derived anti-breast cancer peptides via gel filtration, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) for the first time. The inhibitory effects of the hydrolysates on the cell viabilities, cell cycles and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were evaluated with a cck8 kit and a flow cytometry. The result showed that YMC hydrolysates (YMCH) obtained by united hydrolyzation with trypsin (3 h) and alkaline protease (3 h) displayed the highest cell viability inhibition rate for MCF7 (20.74 ± 1.39%) and MDA-MB-231 (26.73 ± 2.87%) cells. Three peptides were identified in the RP-HPLC subfraction F3-4, and a nonapeptide (TPVVVPPFL) showed the most potent inhibitory effects on both cancer cells and displayed good gastrointestinal stability. TPVVVPPFL could induce G2-M cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells and S cell arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis in both cancer cells. Moreover, in silico analysis indicated that the peptide had non-toxic and no inhibitory roles on P4502D6-enzyme. Together, this study shows that YMC is a good source of anti-breast cancer cells peptides.	10.3389/fnut.2022.997514	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	1.81e-07	8	0	0

This study sought to assess the cholesterol-lowering activity of peptides obtained from milk casein hydrolyzed with neutrase. The bioactive peptides were separated using a Sephadex G-10 chromatographic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) after ultrafiltration using a 1-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we determined that peptides Thr-Asp-Val-Glu-Asn [TDVEN; β-casein f(143–147)], Leu-Gln-Pro-Glu [LQPE; β-casein f(103–106)], Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu [VAPFPE; αS1-casein f(40–45)], and Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln [VLPVPQ β-casein f(185–190)] reduced micellar cholesterol solubility. After Caco-2 cells were treated with LQPE, VLPVPQ, and VAPFPE, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein levels decreased by (means ± SEM) 19.33 ± 2.47%, 52.1 ± 3.77%, and 23.09 ± 8.52%, respectively, compared with the control group. Treatment with each peptide induced significant upregulation of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8 antibody (ABCG8) mRNA expression by 398.1 ± 23.27%, 86.4 ± 27.07%, and 92.8 ± 8.49%. We found that VLPVPQ and LQPE significantly upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transcription by 203.9 ± 8.44% and 220.8 ± 36.42% respectively, whereas VLPVPQ significantly decreased mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) and microsomal triacylglycerols (MTP). The cholesterol-lowering action of milk-derived peptides may be induced by suppression of micellar cholesterol solubility and affects the expression of cholesterol absorption–related proteins and enzymes in intestinal epithelial cells. This research discovers new milk-derived peptides with decreasing cholesterol micellar solubility and provides a theoretical basis of in vitro cholesterol-lowering effects of peptides.	10.3168/jds.2019-17586	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	6	1	6	1.71e-05	6	0	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography.

The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	2	9	1.04e-07	8	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

The aim of the present work was to study the mode of the induction of the biosynthesis of macedocin, the lantibiotic produced by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198. Macedocin was produced when the strain was grown in milk but not in MRS or M17 broth. No autoinduction mechanism was observed. Production did not depend on the presence of lactose or galactose in the culture medium or on a coculture of the producer strain with macedocin-sensitive or macedocin-resistant strains. Induction seemed to depend on the presence of one or more heat-stable protein components produced when S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was grown in milk. The partial purification of the induction factor was performed by a combination of chromatography methods, and its activity was confirmed by a reverse transcription-PCR approach (RT-PCR). Mass spectrometric (MS) and tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analyses of an induction-active fraction showed the presence of several peptides of low molecular mass corresponding to fragments of αS1- and β-casein as well as β-lactoglobulin. The chemically synthesized αS1-casein fragment 37-55 (2,253.65 Da) was proven to be able to induce macedocin biosynthesis.

VEELKPTPEGDLEIL	P02754	LKPTPEGDLEIL	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	62-73	DPP-IV Inhibitory		57.0				Isolation and characterization of peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitory activity from pepsin-treated bovine whey proteins	Lacroix, I. et al.	Inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV is one of the strategies used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, pepsin-treated whey protein isolate (WPI) and α-lactalbumin displaying DPP-IV inhibitory activity were fractionated by successive chromatographic steps and the resulting active fractions analyzed for their constituent peptides by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Among the identified sequences, 24 peptides derived from α-lactalbumin and 11 from β-lactoglobulin were synthesized and their effects on DPP-IV activity assessed. The most potent fragments, LKPTPEGDL and LKPTPEGDLEIL (IC50 = 45 and 57 μM, respectively), were found to inhibit DPP-IV in an un-competitive manner. Although several of the peptides tested showed some inhibitory activity, only two were as effective as the un-fractionated WPI hydrolysate and none were as potent as the un-fractionated α-lactalbumin hydrolysate. The peptides’ structural features, including length and amino acid composition, were found to impact their inhibitory activity. This study provides new insights on the active components responsible for the DPP-IV inhibitory activity of pepsin-treated whey proteins.	10.1016/j.peptides.2014.01.002	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	4	15	1	12	1.96e-12	12	0	0
VEELKPTPEGDLEIL	P02756	VEELKPTPEGNLE	Beta-lactoglobulin	Capra hircus	61-73	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	E. coli		Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice	Almaas, H. et al.	Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	13	1	13	1.88e-11	13	1	0
VEELKPTPEGDLEIL	P02755	YVEELKPTPEGDL	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bubalus bubalis	60-72	Antioxidant						Antioxidant Properties of Buffalo-Milk Dairy Products: A β-Lg Peptide Released after Gastrointestinal Digestion of Buffalo Ricotta Cheese Reduces Oxidative Stress in Intestinal Epithelial Cells	Basilicata, MG. et al.	Redox signaling regulates different gastrointestinal (G.I.) epithelium functions. At the intestinal level, the loss of redox homeostasis in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is responsible for the pathogenesis and development of a wide diversity of G.I. disorders. Thus, the manipulation of oxidative stress in IECs could represent an important pharmacological target for different diseases. In this study, peptides released from in vitro gastro intestinal digestion of different buffalo-milk commercial dairy products were identified and evaluated for their bioactive properties. In particular, six G.I. digests of dairy products were tested in a model of oxidative stress for IECs. Among them, buffalo ricotta cheese was the most active and the presence of an abundant β-lactoglobulin peptide (YVEELKPTPEGDL, f:60-72) was also revealed. The antioxidant potential of the identified peptide was also evaluated in a model of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in the IEC-6 cell line. The peptide was able to reduce ROS release, while, on the other hand, it increased nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) activation and the expression of antioxidant cytoprotective factors, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). These results indicate that buffalo ricotta cheese-isolated peptide could have potential in the treatment of some gastrointestinal disorders.	10.3390/ijms19071955	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	12	2	13	2.73e-12	12	0	0
VEELKPTPEGDLEILL	P02754	VYVEELKPTPEGDLEILLQK	Beta-lactoglobulin	Bos taurus	57-76	Cholesterol regulation	Hypocholesterolemic					Identification of Novel Hypocholesterolemic Peptides Derived from Bovine Milk β-lactoglobulin	Nagaoka, S. et al.	This study was designed to clarify the mechanisms of hypocholesterolemic action of β-lactoglobuline tryptic hydrolysate (LTH) and to identify the novel hypocholesterolemic peptide derived from LTH by screening using Caco-2 cells and animal studies. Serum and liver cholesterol levels were significantly lower in rats fed LTH than in those fed casein tryptic hydrolysate (CTH). The present study suggests that the inhibition of micellar solubility of cholesterol which causes the suppression of cholesterol absorption by a direct interaction between cholesterol mixed micelles, and LTH in the jejunal epithelia is part of the mechanism underlying the hypocholesterolemic action of LTH. Though no one could trace the hypocholesterolemic peptide to any protein origin, we identified, for the first time, a novel hypocholesterolemic peptide, Ile-Ile-Ala-Glu-Lys (IIAEK). Surprisingly, the present study provides the first direct evidence that a new hypocholesterolemic peptide derived from β-lactoglobuline can powerfully influence serum cholesterol levels and exhibit a greater hypocholesterolemic activity in comparison with that of medicine, β-sitosterol, in animal studies.	10.1006/bbrc.2001.4298	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	16	3	18	2.49e-17	16	0	0

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.	10.1021/jf049510t	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	1	11	1	11	2.41e-11	11	0	0

To obtain a bioactive peptide released from casein and investigate the cytomodulatory effect of this bioactive peptide, Lactobacillus helveticus CICC 22171, isolated from traditional Chinese dairy product, was directly used to hydrolyze casein (5 %) at 37 C for 48 h. Ultrafiltration, Sephadex column chromatography and high-speed counter-current chromatography were used to purify the peptide. After obtaining the peptide (named as β-Casobapt-ZW), a battery assays, including acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry analysis, were used to determine the cytomodulatory effect on Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells. The results showed that β-Casobapt-ZW could induce Caco-2 cell shrinkage, chromosome aggregation and apoptotic. The apoptotic rate could reach to 20.36 %. However, the effects were not obvious for IEC-6 cell, and the apoptotic rate was only 3.1 %. β-Casobapt-ZW showed obvious effect on inducing Caco-2 cells apoptosis and could not have significant influence on the growth of IEC-6 cells. The molecular weight of this peptide was about 1,020 Da, and the amino acid sequence was EPVLGPVRGP. It belonged to a fragment of β-casein (β-CN, f210–219).	10.1007/s00217-013-2106-7	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.04e-07	8	0	0

After obtaining the peptide (named as β-Casobapt-ZW), a battery assays, including acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry analysis, were used to determine the cytomodulatory effect on Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells. The results showed that β-Casobapt-ZW could induce Caco-2 cell shrinkage, chromosome aggregation and apoptotic. The apoptotic rate could reach to 20.36 %. However, the effects were not obvious for IEC-6 cell, and the apoptotic rate was only 3.1 %. β-Casobapt-ZW showed obvious effect on inducing Caco-2 cells apoptosis and could not have significant influence on the growth of IEC-6 cells. The molecular weight of this peptide was about 1,020 Da, and the amino acid sequence was EPVLGPVRGP. It belonged to a fragment of β-casein (β-CN, f210–219).	10.1007/s00217-013-2106-7	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	3	10	1.63e-07	8	0	0

VLGPVRGPFPIIV	P02666	QEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	209-224	ACE-inhibitory		600.0				Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory peptides in commercial Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses of different ages	Lu, Y. et al.	Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.	10.3168/jds.2015-9569	sequence	IDENTITY	81.25	1	13	4	16	9.24e-14	13	0	0

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.

VLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antiapoptotic effect						 Anti-apoptotic effect of buffalo milk casein-derived bioactive peptide by directing Nrf2 regulation in starving fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Starvation conditions cause cell injury or ulcers from reactive oxygen species generation and, ultimately, lead to cell death or apoptosis. Milk has many bioactive peptides with cytoprotective potential. One such peptide is the buffalo milk β-casein derived antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. It was found to have cytoprotective action during oxidative stress. However, the protective role of the peptide in natural aging induced apoptosis has not been studied. In the present study, the anti-apoptotic effect of the peptide was analyzed by establishing an in vitro model of skin fibroblast cells with serum starved conditions similar to aging. Cell survivability and cytotoxicity were measured using MTT and LDH assays, respectively. Cell death rate was determined using propidium iodide staining. In addition, gene level expression of anti-apoptotic markers’ such as Nrf2, Keap-1, Bcl-2, Bax and HO-1 were analyzed using quantitative real time-PCR. While nuclear transmigration of Nrf2 at the protein level was analyzed using western blots. The peptide treatment led to inhibition of cell death as observed using PI, DCFH-DA staining and improvement in cell survival through the activation of transcription factor, Nrf2. The activation of Nrf2 stimulated the expression of cytoprotective signals from HO-1. Moreover, the peptide augmented the cellular protection by inhibiting the expression of the Nrf2 inhibitor (Keap1), pro-apoptotic markers (Bax) and stimulating anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) gene expression. In addition, a pronounced reduction in the activity of the cell injury marker, LDH was observed. Hence, this study showed that the antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK also showed an anti-apoptotic effect.	10.1016/j.fbio.2020.100566	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0
VLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antimicrobial				Gram negative		Isolation and identification of some antibacterial peptides in the plasmin-digest of β-casein	Sedaghati, H. et al.	This study was an attempt to explore the antibacterial properties of plasmin and plasmin generated peptides from bovine β-casein, and then to identify active peptides using RP-HPLC. The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0
VLPVPQ	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Wound healing						Nrf2 dependent antiaging effect of milk derived bioactive peptide in old fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Prolonged passaging of primary fibroblast cells totally shapes the natural biological phenomena and leads to the appearance of features related to senescence. As a result, it is a good natural tool to delineate the molecular mechanism of cellular aging. The present investigation revealed the antiaging effect of milk-derived novel bioactive peptide (VLPVPQK). The peptide played an important role in downregulating apoptosis-related markers in late passages of cultured fibroblast cells. The peptide treatment to aged fibroblasts caused enhancement in cell migration, DNA integrity, and decrease in the lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide production as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, the peptide decreased the expression of apoptotic caspases, Bax, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) proteins. The peptide pretreatment also enhanced the extracellular collagen protein and antiapoptotic, Bcl-xL. In addition, the peptide treatment reversed the senescence-related activity in fibroblasts by stimulating Nrf2 mediated antioxidative defense system and inhibiting the action of NFkB/p38MAPK signaling, similar to the commercially available inhibitor (SB203580) of p38MAPK. Thus, the peptide exhibits the antiaging effect in dermal fibroblast cells.	10.1002/jcb.28246	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0
VLPVPQ	P02666	KVLPVPQ	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	184-190	Immunomodulatory	Anti-inflammatory					Characterization of casein derived peptide bioactivity: Differential effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and cytokine and nitric oxide production	Adams, C. et al.	Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	2.37e-05	6	0	0
VLPVPQ	P02666	LPVPQ	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	186-190	DPP-IV Inhibitory		43.8				Structure activity relationship modelling of milk protein-derived peptides with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity	Nongonierma, A. et al.	Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	6	1	5	5.00e-04	5	0	0

This study sought to assess the cholesterol-lowering activity of peptides obtained from milk casein hydrolyzed with neutrase. The bioactive peptides were separated using a Sephadex G-10 chromatographic column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) after ultrafiltration using a 1-kDa molecular mass cutoff membrane. Via ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, we determined that peptides Thr-Asp-Val-Glu-Asn [TDVEN; β-casein f(143–147)], Leu-Gln-Pro-Glu [LQPE; β-casein f(103–106)], Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu [VAPFPE; αS1-casein f(40–45)], and Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln [VLPVPQ β-casein f(185–190)] reduced micellar cholesterol solubility. After Caco-2 cells were treated with LQPE, VLPVPQ, and VAPFPE, the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein levels decreased by (means ± SEM) 19.33 ± 2.47%, 52.1 ± 3.77%, and 23.09 ± 8.52%, respectively, compared with the control group. Treatment with each peptide induced significant upregulation of ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 8 antibody (ABCG8) mRNA expression by 398.1 ± 23.27%, 86.4 ± 27.07%, and 92.8 ± 8.49%. We found that VLPVPQ and LQPE significantly upregulated ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) transcription by 203.9 ± 8.44% and 220.8 ± 36.42% respectively, whereas VLPVPQ significantly decreased mRNA expression of acetyl-CoA-acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2) and microsomal triacylglycerols (MTP). The cholesterol-lowering action of milk-derived peptides may be induced by suppression of micellar cholesterol solubility and affects the expression of cholesterol absorption–related proteins and enzymes in intestinal epithelial cells. This research discovers new milk-derived peptides with decreasing cholesterol micellar solubility and provides a theoretical basis of in vitro cholesterol-lowering effects of peptides.	10.3168/jds.2019-17586	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	6	1	6	1.71e-05	6	0	0

The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.	10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	7	1	7	9.79e-07	7	0	0
VLPVPQK	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Wound healing						Nrf2 dependent antiaging effect of milk derived bioactive peptide in old fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Prolonged passaging of primary fibroblast cells totally shapes the natural biological phenomena and leads to the appearance of features related to senescence. As a result, it is a good natural tool to delineate the molecular mechanism of cellular aging. The present investigation revealed the antiaging effect of milk-derived novel bioactive peptide (VLPVPQK). The peptide played an important role in downregulating apoptosis-related markers in late passages of cultured fibroblast cells. The peptide treatment to aged fibroblasts caused enhancement in cell migration, DNA integrity, and decrease in the lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide production as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, the peptide decreased the expression of apoptotic caspases, Bax, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) proteins. The peptide pretreatment also enhanced the extracellular collagen protein and antiapoptotic, Bcl-xL. In addition, the peptide treatment reversed the senescence-related activity in fibroblasts by stimulating Nrf2 mediated antioxidative defense system and inhibiting the action of NFkB/p38MAPK signaling, similar to the commercially available inhibitor (SB203580) of p38MAPK. Thus, the peptide exhibits the antiaging effect in dermal fibroblast cells.	10.1002/jcb.28246	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	7	1	7	9.79e-07	7	0	0
VLPVPQKA	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	ACE-inhibitory		15.0				Transepithelial transport of milk derived bioactive peptide VLPVPQK	Vij, R. et al.	The transepithelial transport of an antioxidative and ACE inhibitory peptide, VLPVPQK (named peptide C) derived from casein hydrolysates was investigated along with extensively studied opioid peptide β-casomorphin using a human intestinal cell (Caco-2) monolayer. The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.121	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0
VLPVPQKA	P02666	VLPVPQK	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	185-191	Antiapoptotic effect						 Anti-apoptotic effect of buffalo milk casein-derived bioactive peptide by directing Nrf2 regulation in starving fibroblasts	Kumar, N. et al.	Starvation conditions cause cell injury or ulcers from reactive oxygen species generation and, ultimately, lead to cell death or apoptosis. Milk has many bioactive peptides with cytoprotective potential. One such peptide is the buffalo milk β-casein derived antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. It was found to have cytoprotective action during oxidative stress. However, the protective role of the peptide in natural aging induced apoptosis has not been studied. In the present study, the anti-apoptotic effect of the peptide was analyzed by establishing an in vitro model of skin fibroblast cells with serum starved conditions similar to aging. Cell survivability and cytotoxicity were measured using MTT and LDH assays, respectively. Cell death rate was determined using propidium iodide staining. In addition, gene level expression of anti-apoptotic markers’ such as Nrf2, Keap-1, Bcl-2, Bax and HO-1 were analyzed using quantitative real time-PCR. While nuclear transmigration of Nrf2 at the protein level was analyzed using western blots. The peptide treatment led to inhibition of cell death as observed using PI, DCFH-DA staining and improvement in cell survival through the activation of transcription factor, Nrf2. The activation of Nrf2 stimulated the expression of cytoprotective signals from HO-1. Moreover, the peptide augmented the cellular protection by inhibiting the expression of the Nrf2 inhibitor (Keap1), pro-apoptotic markers (Bax) and stimulating anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) gene expression. In addition, a pronounced reduction in the activity of the cell injury marker, LDH was observed. Hence, this study showed that the antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK also showed an anti-apoptotic effect.	10.1016/j.fbio.2020.100566	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Tonolo, F. et al.	Redox status and inflammation are related to the pathogenesis of the majority of diseases. Therefore, understanding the role of specific food-derived molecules in the regulation of their specific pathways is a relevant issue. Our previous studies indicated that K-8-K and S-10-S, milk and soy-derived bioactive peptides, respectively, exert antioxidant effects through activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. A crosstalk between Nrf2 and NF-κB, mediated by the action of heme oxygenase (HO-1), is well known. On this basis, we studied if these peptides, in addition to their antioxidant activity, could exert anti-inflammatory effects in human cells. First, we observed an increase of HO-1 expression in Caco-2 cells treated with K-8-K and S-10-S, following the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway. Moreover, when cells are treated with the two peptides and stimulated by TNF-α, the levels of NF-κB in the nucleus decreased in comparison with TNF-α alone. In the same conditions, we observed the downregulation of the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL6, and TNF), while the anti-inflammatory cytokine gene, IL1RN, was upregulated in Caco-2 cells processed as reported above. Then, when the cells were pretreated with the two peptides and stimulated with LPS, a different proinflammatory factor, (TNF-α) was estimated to have a lower secretion in the supernatant of cells. In conclusion, these observations confirmed that Nrf2-activating bioactive peptides, K-8-K and S-10-S, exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway.	10.3390/ijms23084382	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	2	8	2.16e-06	7	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a serine protease involved in the degradation and inactivation of incretin hormones that act by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion after meal ingestion. DPP-IV inhibitors have emerged as new and promising oral agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of β-lactoglobulin as natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. A whey protein concentrate rich in β-lactoglobulin was hydrolysed with trypsin and fractionated using a chromatographic separation at semipreparative scale. Two of the six collected fractions showed notable DPP-IV inhibitory activity. These fractions were analysed by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to identify peptides responsible for the observed activity. The most potent fragment (IPAVF) corresponded to β-lactoglobulin f(78–82) which IC50 value was 44.7 μM. The results suggest that peptides derived from β-lactoglobulin would be beneficial ingredients of foods against type 2 diabetes.	10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.03.056	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	9	1	9	3.24e-09	9	0	0

Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	7	1	7	9.79e-07	7	0	0

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. This is the first report that has identified DPP-4-inhibitory casein-derived peptides from gouda-type cheese with an effect on plasma glucose in a rat model.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2011.08.002	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers.

In this study, several peptides, which had previously been identified in active HPLC fractions from Manchego cheese, were synthesised and their angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities were measured. From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased. The peptides not hydrolysed by gastrointestinal enzymes and peptide VRYL, which was only partly hydrolysed, were incubated with ACE and were found to be true inhibitors of the enzyme and to have a competitive inhibition pattern.	10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.04.007	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.	10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.05.004	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	25	2	26	3.22e-28	25	0	0

Scope

β-casofensin, also known as peptide β-CN(94-123), is a milk bioactive peptide that modulates the intestinal barrier through its action on goblet cells. Here, we evaluated whether oral administration of β-casofensin can prevent indomethacin-induced injury of the jejunum in rats.
Methods and results

Rats received β-casofensin (0.01–100 μM) or tap water by daily gavage (4 μL/g) for eight days, then two subcutaneous injections of indomethacin (10 mg/kg, days 9 and 10) and were euthanized on day 12. In vitro, we investigated the effects of β-casofensin on the restitution of a wounded monolayer. Preventive administration of β-casofensin (100 μM) reduced intestinal macroscopic and microscopic damage induced by indomethacin. β-casofensin also prevented the depletion of goblet cells and increased myeloperoxidase activity, as well as tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (TNF-ɑ) expression and immunostaining of active caspase-3 in the jejunum of rats treated with indomethacin. In wound healing experiments, β-casofensin promoted epithelial restitution with no effect on cell proliferation. This effect was inhibited by pre-incubation with an anti-CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) neutralizing antibody.
Conclusions

β-casofensin exerts protective effects in indomethacin-induced enteritis through preservation of goblet cells and improvement in wound healing. β-casofensin could therefore become vital in nutritional programs for the prevention of intestinal diseases."	10.1002/mnfr.201500680	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	25	2	26	3.22e-28	25	0	0

Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown.

Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90).

Recently, some physiological significance of peptide fragments derived from milk proteins has been suggested. 1) It has recently been reported that synthetic peptide inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) possibly act as anti-amnestic agents. 2 ) In our previous paper,3) we described the synthesis of a number of peptide fragments of human β-casein, and found that PEP activity was inhibited by the synthetic pep tides within amino acid redidues 49-59 (Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro-Tyr) of β-casein, and the most potent inhibitor was Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-GluPro-Ile (50-57, IC50 = 8 11M)	10.1271/bbb.56.976	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.36e-06	7	0	0

The effects of wheat gluten fragments, hemoglobin, and milk β-caseins (exorphine C, hemorphine-6, and β-casomorphine-7) on nociceptive sensitivity and behavior were studied in albino rats. Hemorphine-6 and exorphine C induced hyperalgesia and increased anxiety; β-casomorphine-7 decreased anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. All peptides partially decreased motor activity and the orientative-exploring reaction. In contrast to β-casomorphine-7, exorphine C and hemorphine-6 did not exhibit neurotropic activity intrinsic to opioids and can be characterized as functional antagonists of endogenous opioid peptides.	10.1007/BF02496839	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

In the present study in vivo impact of consumption of β-casomorphins (BCM-7/5) was evaluated on immune response of murine gut. The peptides were given to mice through oral intubation at a dose of 7.5 × 10−8 mol/day/animal for 15 days. Oral administration of both peptides individually increased (p <0.01) phenotypic expression of inflammation associated molecules (MPO, MCP-1, IL-4 and histamine), humoral immune response (IgE, IgG, IgG1/IgG2a), infiltration of leucocytes in intestinal villi and mRNA expression of toll like receptors (TLR-2 and TLR-4) in mice gut. However, no changes in sIgA, IgA+ and goblet cell numbers were recorded. These results clearly indicate that consumption of β-casein derived peptides BCM-7/5 induce inflammatory immune response in gut, most likely through Th2 pathway.	10.1016/j.jff.2014.03.018	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

Understanding the digestive behaviour and biological activities of dairy proteins may help to develop model dairy products with targeted health outcomes including increased satiety and healthy weight maintenance. Caseins and whey proteins constitute over 95% of milk proteins with consumption of these proteins associated with increased satiety and a decreased prevalence of metabolic disorders. To investigate the in vitro digestive behaviour and satiety of dairy proteins at the intestinal epithelium, the in vitro transport and hydrolysis of 500–2000 μM β-casomorphin-7 (YPFPGPI or β-CM7) and a β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) dipeptide (YL) was measured using Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on transwells as a model of the intestinal epithelium. Transport of YL was concentration dependent and ranged from 0.37–5.26 × 10−6 cm s−1, whereas transport of β-CM7 was only detected at 2000 μM and was significantly lower at 0.13 × 10−6 cm s−1. Rapid hydrolysis of β-CM7 in the apical chamber by the Caco-2 cells produced three peptide metabolites: YP, GPI and FPGPI. All of these metabolites were detected in the basolateral chamber after 30 min with both the YP and GPI peptides transporting at a higher rate than intact β-CM7. In vitro satiety was indicated by the secretion of cholecystokinin [26–33] (CCK-8) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-17–36NH2) in the STC-1 enteroendocrine cell model. CCK-8 secretion was highest in response to β-CM7 followed by the β-CM7 metabolite FPGPI. CCK-8 secretion however was not significantly stimulated by the tri- or dipeptides. Secretion of GLP-1 was not significantly stimulated by β-CM7 or YL. These in vitro results suggest that dairy peptide size enhances CCK-8 secretion, whilst limiting transport across Caco-2 monolayers.	10.1039/c4fo00164h	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	3.85e-05	6	0	0

Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.	10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	2	7	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes. With liquid chromatography, we obtained four active fractions from the water-soluble extract and analysed the constituent peptides with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Four peptides with the X–Pro-structure showed IC50 values of <200 μm. β-Casein peptide residues 70–77 (β-CN f70–77; LPQNIPPL) showed the highest DPP-4-inhibitory activity, which increased during the ripening period. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in rats orally administered synthesized LPQNIPPL (30 mg 100 g−1 rat weight) with a cross-over experimental design. The post-prandial area under the blood glucose curve was significantly reduced (P < 0.02) in the LPQNIPPL-administered group compared with that in the placebo-treated group.

Food protein-derived peptides with agonistic effects on receptors have great potential for treating anxiety, hypertension, and stress. In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for δ-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of β-casomorphin (CM-10) (β-casein 60–69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards δ- and μ-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for δ- and μ-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized δ-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of δ- or μ-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut δ- and/or μ-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.	10.1039/d2fo01793h	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	2	10	1	9	1.69e-06	9	1	0

Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.	10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5	sequence	IDENTITY	81.82	1	10	1	10	7.29e-08	10	1	0

Redox signaling regulates different gastrointestinal (G.I.) epithelium functions. At the intestinal level, the loss of redox homeostasis in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is responsible for the pathogenesis and development of a wide diversity of G.I. disorders. Thus, the manipulation of oxidative stress in IECs could represent an important pharmacological target for different diseases. In this study, peptides released from in vitro gastro intestinal digestion of different buffalo-milk commercial dairy products were identified and evaluated for their bioactive properties. In particular, six G.I. digests of dairy products were tested in a model of oxidative stress for IECs. Among them, buffalo ricotta cheese was the most active and the presence of an abundant β-lactoglobulin peptide (YVEELKPTPEGDL, f:60-72) was also revealed. The antioxidant potential of the identified peptide was also evaluated in a model of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in the IEC-6 cell line.

Redox signaling regulates different gastrointestinal (G.I.) epithelium functions. At the intestinal level, the loss of redox homeostasis in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is responsible for the pathogenesis and development of a wide diversity of G.I. disorders. Thus, the manipulation of oxidative stress in IECs could represent an important pharmacological target for different diseases. In this study, peptides released from in vitro gastro intestinal digestion of different buffalo-milk commercial dairy products were identified and evaluated for their bioactive properties. In particular, six G.I. digests of dairy products were tested in a model of oxidative stress for IECs. Among them, buffalo ricotta cheese was the most active and the presence of an abundant β-lactoglobulin peptide (YVEELKPTPEGDL, f:60-72) was also revealed. The antioxidant potential of the identified peptide was also evaluated in a model of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in the IEC-6 cell line. The peptide was able to reduce ROS release, while, on the other hand, it increased nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) activation and the expression of antioxidant cytoprotective factors, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD).

VYVEELKPTPEGDLE	P02756	VEELKPTPEGNLE	Beta-lactoglobulin	Capra hircus	61-73	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	E. coli		Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice	Almaas, H. et al.	Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	15	1	13	1.88e-11	13	1	0

This study was designed to clarify the mechanisms of hypocholesterolemic action of β-lactoglobuline tryptic hydrolysate (LTH) and to identify the novel hypocholesterolemic peptide derived from LTH by screening using Caco-2 cells and animal studies. Serum and liver cholesterol levels were significantly lower in rats fed LTH than in those fed casein tryptic hydrolysate (CTH). The present study suggests that the inhibition of micellar solubility of cholesterol which causes the suppression of cholesterol absorption by a direct interaction between cholesterol mixed micelles, and LTH in the jejunal epithelia is part of the mechanism underlying the hypocholesterolemic action of LTH. Though no one could trace the hypocholesterolemic peptide to any protein origin, we identified, for the first time, a novel hypocholesterolemic peptide, Ile-Ile-Ala-Glu-Lys (IIAEK). Surprisingly, the present study provides the first direct evidence that a new hypocholesterolemic peptide derived from β-lactoglobuline can powerfully influence serum cholesterol levels and exhibit a greater hypocholesterolemic activity in comparison with that of medicine, β-sitosterol, in animal studies.	10.1006/bbrc.2001.4298	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	1	18	1	18	5.08e-20	18	0	0

Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.	10.1002/biof.1023	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	2	11	1	10	5.36e-10	10	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	92.31	1	12	2	13	8.85e-13	12	0	0

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.	10.3168/jds.2019-17976	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	12	1	12	6.38e-13	12	0	0

Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

The ability of casein phosphopeptides (CPPs) to bind and transport minerals has been previously studied. However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

YLGYLE	P02662	RYLGYL	Alpha-S1-casein	Bos taurus	105-110	Opioid						Opioid activities and structures of α-casein-derived exorphins	Loukas, S. et al.	Exorphins, peptides with opioid activity, have previously been isolated from pepsin hydrolysates of alpha-casein [Zioudrou, C., Streaty, R. A., & Klee, W. A. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 2446-2449]. Analysis of these peptides shows that they correspond to the sequences 90-96, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu, and 90-95, Arg-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu, of alpha-casein. These peptides, as well as two of their analogues Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu-Glu (91-96) and Tyr-Leu-Gly-Tyr-Leu (91-95), have now been synthesized and characterized. Their opioid activity was examined by three different bioassays: (a) displacement of D-2-alanyl[tyrosyl-3,5-3H]enkephalin-(5-L-methioninamide) and [3H]dihydromorphine from rat brain membranes; (b) naloxone-reversible inhibition of adenylate cyclase in homogenates of neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid cells; (c) naloxone-reversible inhibition of electrically stimulated contractions of the mouse vas deferens. The synthetic peptide of sequence 90-96 was the most potent opioid in all three bioassays and its potency was similar to that of the isolated alpha-casein exorphins. The synthetic peptides were totally resistant to hydrolysis by trypsin and homogenates of rat brain membranes, but were partially inactivated by chymotrypsin and subtilisin. The difference in opioid activity of alpha-casein exorphins may be related to differences in conformational flexibility observed by NMR spectroscopy.	10.1021/bi00288a034	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	5	2	6	6.95e-04	5	0	0

Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	6	1	6	1.71e-05	6	0	0

In previous studies, we have shown that opioid agonists ([d-Ala2,d-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE), [d-Ser2,Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET), ethylketocyclazocine and etorphine) bind to opioid binding sites and decrease cell proliferation of human T47D breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity. Finally, we show that these peptides are also partial competitors at the somatostatin receptors present in the same cell line.	10.1016/0014-2999(96)00339-1	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	2	7	3.85e-05	6	0	0

Hydrolyzed infant formulas serve as appropriate nutritional sources for infants afflicted with cow’s milk allergy, and milk proteins in hydrolyzed formulas are industrially hydrolyzed extensively or partially. To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared. One standard, one extensively hydrolyzed, and one partially hydrolyzed infant formula were digested in vitro with pepsin and pancreatin, taking into account the higher gastric pH of infants, and the digesta were subjected to peptidomic analysis. The standard formula released a larger variety of bioactive peptides than from the hydrolyzed formulas, indicating that industrial hydrolysis of milk proteins may generally attenuate their indigenous bioactivities such as antibacterial, immuno-regulatory, and anti-oxidative activities. Conversely, industrial hydrolysis may facilitate the formation of bioactive peptides from hydrophobic proteins/regions such as β-LG and the “strategic zone” of β-CN, which encrypt bioactive peptides including a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4-inhibitory, hypocholesterolemic, and opioid peptides. Infants fed hydrolyzed infant formulas may be influenced by milk protein-derived bioactive peptides in a manner different from those fed standard formula.	10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.005	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	10	1	10	1.88e-10	10	0	0

The effects of wheat gluten fragments, hemoglobin, and milk β-caseins (exorphine C, hemorphine-6, and β-casomorphine-7) on nociceptive sensitivity and behavior were studied in albino rats. Hemorphine-6 and exorphine C induced hyperalgesia and increased anxiety; β-casomorphine-7 decreased anxiety and nociceptive sensitivity. All peptides partially decreased motor activity and the orientative-exploring reaction. In contrast to β-casomorphine-7, exorphine C and hemorphine-6 did not exhibit neurotropic activity intrinsic to opioids and can be characterized as functional antagonists of endogenous opioid peptides.	10.1007/BF02496839	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0

Understanding the digestive behaviour and biological activities of dairy proteins may help to develop model dairy products with targeted health outcomes including increased satiety and healthy weight maintenance. Caseins and whey proteins constitute over 95% of milk proteins with consumption of these proteins associated with increased satiety and a decreased prevalence of metabolic disorders. To investigate the in vitro digestive behaviour and satiety of dairy proteins at the intestinal epithelium, the in vitro transport and hydrolysis of 500–2000 μM β-casomorphin-7 (YPFPGPI or β-CM7) and a β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg) dipeptide (YL) was measured using Caco-2 cell monolayers grown on transwells as a model of the intestinal epithelium. Transport of YL was concentration dependent and ranged from 0.37–5.26 × 10−6 cm s−1, whereas transport of β-CM7 was only detected at 2000 μM and was significantly lower at 0.13 × 10−6 cm s−1. Rapid hydrolysis of β-CM7 in the apical chamber by the Caco-2 cells produced three peptide metabolites: YP, GPI and FPGPI. All of these metabolites were detected in the basolateral chamber after 30 min with both the YP and GPI peptides transporting at a higher rate than intact β-CM7. In vitro satiety was indicated by the secretion of cholecystokinin [26–33] (CCK-8) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-17–36NH2) in the STC-1 enteroendocrine cell model. CCK-8 secretion was highest in response to β-CM7 followed by the β-CM7 metabolite FPGPI. CCK-8 secretion however was not significantly stimulated by the tri- or dipeptides. Secretion of GLP-1 was not significantly stimulated by β-CM7 or YL. These in vitro results suggest that dairy peptide size enhances CCK-8 secretion, whilst limiting transport across Caco-2 monolayers.	10.1039/c4fo00164h	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.37e-05	6	0	0
YPFPGP	P02666	YPFPG	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-79	Increase intestinal motility						An in vitro rat model of colonic motility to determine the effect of β-casomorphin-5 on propagating contractions	Dalziel, J E. et al.	Beta-casomorphin-5 (βCM-5) is a milk-derived bioactive peptide that slows gastro-intestinal transit (GIT) in vivo and blocks the peristaltic reflex in the guinea pig colon in vitro. We wanted to establish an in vitro model system in which effects of dairy-derived substances containing opioid peptides on intestinal motility can be assessed and used to predict in vivo outcomes. Because βCM-5 is an opioid agonist that acts on enteric neurons, we used this substance to compare two different isolated colonic tissue preparations to determine which would more closely mimic the in vivo response previously reported in the literature. We compared and characterized the effects of βCM-5 on spontaneous contractions in isolated segments of distal colon (1 cm length) compared with propagating contractions along the isolated intact large intestine (22 cm length). In short segments of distal colon, βCM-5 increased the tension and frequency of spontaneous contractions in a concentration-dependent manner. At 20 μM βCM-5 tension increased by 71 ± 17% and the frequency doubled (n = 9), effects inhibited by naloxone (n = 7) and therefore mediated by opioid receptors. In contrast 20 μM βCM-5 disrupted propagating contractions in the large intestine preparation. At 20 μM βCM-5 reduced the proportion of contractions initiated in the proximal colon reaching the rectum by 83 ± 11% (n = 5) and this effect was also inhibited by naloxone, consistent with altered GIT reported in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the isolated whole large intestine provides an ideal preparation that mimics the reduced propagation of GIT in vivo in response to an opioid agonist, whereas short colon segments did not. The findings of the current study reveal that preserving large segments of intact large intestine, and hence intact enteric neural circuitry provides an ideal in vitro model to investigate the effect of opioid receptor modulators on intestinal transit.	10.1039/c4fo00193a	sequence	IDENTITY	83.33	1	5	1	5	5.00e-04	5	0	0

Quantitative structure activity type models were developed in an attempt to predict the key features of peptide sequences having dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM).

Two cathepsin B inhibitory peptides were isolated from a commercial pancreatic digest of casein. The peptides were identified as the Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile and the Gly-Pro-Phe-Pro-Ile corresponding to the sequence 61–66 and 203–207 of bovine β-casein. These peptides showed competitive inhibition for cathepsin B with the Ki values of 2.31 and 3.30 mM, respectively.

The effects of wheat gluten fragments, hemoglobin, and milk β-caseins (exorphine C, hemorphine-6, and β-casomorphine-7) on nociceptive sensitivity and behavior were studied in albino rats.

Food protein-derived peptides with agonistic effects on receptors have great potential for treating anxiety, hypertension, and stress. In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for δ-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of β-casomorphin (CM-10) (β-casein 60–69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards δ- and μ-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for δ- and μ-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized δ-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of δ- or μ-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut δ- and/or μ-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.	10.1039/d2fo01793h	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	9	1	9	1.16e-06	9	1	0

Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme.

In vitro satiety was indicated by the secretion of cholecystokinin [26–33] (CCK-8) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-17–36NH2) in the STC-1 enteroendocrine cell model. CCK-8 secretion was highest in response to β-CM7 followed by the β-CM7 metabolite FPGPI. CCK-8 secretion however was not significantly stimulated by the tri- or dipeptides. Secretion of GLP-1 was not significantly stimulated by β-CM7 or YL. These in vitro results suggest that dairy peptide size enhances CCK-8 secretion, whilst limiting transport across Caco-2 monolayers.	10.1039/c4fo00164h	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.55e-06	7	0	0
YPFPGPIPN	P02666	YPFPGPIPNS	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	75-84	Antianxiety						Release of an anti-anxiety peptide in casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease	Takeuchi, Y. et al.	Food protein-derived peptides with agonistic effects on receptors have great potential for treating anxiety, hypertension, and stress. In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for δ-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of β-casomorphin (CM-10) (β-casein 60–69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards δ- and μ-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for δ- and μ-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized δ-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of δ- or μ-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut δ- and/or μ-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.	10.1039/d2fo01793h	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	1	9	1	9	4.50e-09	9	0	0

A water-soluble extract of a gouda-type cheese showed dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP-4)-inhibitory activity, which should improve glucose tolerance in type 2 diabetes.

YPFPGPIPNSLPQ	P33048	PFTGPIPNSLPQ	Beta-casein	Capra hircus	76-87	Antimicrobial			% Colonies Inhibited	E. coli B. cereus		Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice	Almaas, H. et al.	Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.	10.1017/S0007114511001085	sequence	IDENTITY	84.62	2	13	1	12	2.37e-10	12	1	0
YPSYGLN	P02668	YPSYGL	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	56-61	DPP-IV Inhibitory						In  vitro and in silico evaluation of multifunctional properties  of  bioactive  synthetic  peptides  identified  in  milk  fermented  with Lactococcus  lactis NRRL  B-50571  and  NRRL  B-50572.	Rendon-Rosales, M. et al.	The aim of this study was to investigate the multifunctional properties of specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 on the inhibition of enzymes involved in hypertension (ACE), type 2 diabetes (DPP-IV) and thrombosis (thrombin). Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities. Also, in silico analysis was employed for the prediction of sequences after digestion. Results showed that peptide inhibitory activities on ACE, DPP-IV and thrombin were enhanced after digestion. After in vitro digestion, peptide NAVPITPTLN showed the best efficiency to inhibit DPP-IV. Likewise, NAVPITPTLN and QEPVLGPVRGPFIIV showed high thrombin inhibitory activities, and HPHPHLSFMAIPP and SLPQNIPPL presented high ACE inhibitory activities. In vitro and in silico studies indicated that these peptides are precursors of multifunctional peptide sequences. Therefore, this study suggests that the specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 offer potential beneficial health effects in the management of hypertension, thrombosis and diabetes.	10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112581	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Peptides that display bradykinin-potentiating activity have been obtained from a number of distinct sources, such as snake venoms, fibrinogen, and casein. This paper describes the characterization of two new peptides generated by tryptic hydrolysis of casein. No homology was found with other known vasoactive or vasopotentiating peptides, especially by the lack of Ile-Pro-Pro motif. The peptides EMPFPK and YPVEPFTE, corresponding to the gamma casein sequence (108–113 and 114–121, respectively), displayed a selective potentiating activity on isolated guinea pig ileum for bradykinin. Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay. The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response.	10.1023/b:jopc.0000008724.98339.ff	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	1	7	1.36e-06	7	0	0
YPVEPFT	P02666	YPVEPF	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Antimicrobial						Two New Secreted Proteases Generate a Casein derived Antimicrobial Peptide in Bacillus cereus Food Born Isolate Leading to Bacterial Competition in Milk	Ouertani, A. et al.	Milk and dairy products harbor a wide variety of bacterial species that compete for both limited resources and space. Under these competitive conditions, bacteria develop specialized mechanisms to protect themselves during niche colonization and nutrient acquisition processes. The bacterial antagonism mechanisms include the production of antimicrobial agents or molecules that facilitate competitor dispersal. In the present work, a bacterial strain designated RC6 was isolated from Ricotta and identified as Bacillus cereus. It generates antimicrobial peptide (AMP) when grown in the presence of casein. The AMP was active against several species of Bacillus and Listeria monocytogenes. MALDI-TOF analysis of the RP-HPLC purified fractions and amino acid sequencing revealed a molecular mass of 751 Da comprised of a 6-residue sequence, YPVEPF. BLAST analysis showed that the AMP corresponds to the fractions 114–119 of bovine β-casein and represents the product of a specific proteolysis. Analysis of the purified proteolytic fractions from the B. cereus RC6 culture supernatant indicated that the presence of at least two different endoproteases is crucial for the generation of the AMP. Indeed, we were able to identify two new candidate endoproteases by means of genome sequencing and functional assignment using a 3D structural model and molecular docking of misannotated hypothetical proteins. In this light, the capacity of B. cereus RC6 to generate antimicrobial peptides from casein, through the production of extracellular enzymes, presents a new model of antagonistic competition leading to niche colonization. Hence, as a dairy product contaminant, this strategy may enable proteolytic B. cereus RC6 niche specialization in milk matrices.	10.3389/fmicb.2018.01148	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0
YPVEPFT	P02666	YPVEPF	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	129-134	Antioxidant						In Silico and In Vitro Analysis of Multifunctionality of Animal Food-Derived Peptides	Amigo, L. et al.	Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.	10.3390/foods9080991	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

We recently reported the identification of a peptide from yoghurts with promising potential for intestinal health: the sequence (94-123) of bovine β-casein. This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.	10.1017/S0022029914000533	sequence	IDENTITY	85.71	1	6	1	6	2.77e-05	6	0	0

Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.	10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0	sequence	IDENTITY	86.67	1	13	2	14	7.02e-14	13	0	0

Various bioactive peptides are identified from casein hydrolysates. YQEPVLGPVR (PICA), a novel antithrombotic peptide derived from beta-casein (fragment 193-202), was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The anticoagulation activity assay showed that this peptide has a strong anticoagulant activity. It was proved that the peptide did not interact with the active site of thrombin to inhibit thrombin, and that it inhibited thrombin activity by binding the exosite-1 of thrombin, which was also confirmed by the fibrinogen clotting time assay. It was shown that PICA prolonged fibrinogen clotting time in a dose-dependent manner. Secondary structures of the thrombin-PICA complex were also measured by circular dichroism to prove that PICA can combine with thrombin. Moreover, Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software was used for molecular docking to provide the potential mechanism for the antithrombotic activity of the peptide. These results suggested that PICA probably can be used as an antithrombotic ingredient in the functional food industry.	10.1039/c8fo02235f	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	1	8	1	8	1.04e-07	8	0	0

To obtain a bioactive peptide released from casein and investigate the cytomodulatory effect of this bioactive peptide, Lactobacillus helveticus CICC 22171, isolated from traditional Chinese dairy product, was directly used to hydrolyze casein (5 %) at 37 C for 48 h. Ultrafiltration, Sephadex column chromatography and high-speed counter-current chromatography were used to purify the peptide. After obtaining the peptide (named as β-Casobapt-ZW), a battery assays, including acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry analysis, were used to determine the cytomodulatory effect on Caco-2 and IEC-6 cells. The results showed that β-Casobapt-ZW could induce Caco-2 cell shrinkage, chromosome aggregation and apoptotic. The apoptotic rate could reach to 20.36 %. However, the effects were not obvious for IEC-6 cell, and the apoptotic rate was only 3.1 %. β-Casobapt-ZW showed obvious effect on inducing Caco-2 cells apoptosis and could not have significant influence on the growth of IEC-6 cells. The molecular weight of this peptide was about 1,020 Da, and the amino acid sequence was EPVLGPVRGP. It belonged to a fragment of β-casein (β-CN, f210–219).	10.1007/s00217-013-2106-7	sequence	IDENTITY	80.0	3	10	1	8	2.43e-07	8	0	0
YQEPVLGPVR	P02666	YQEPVLGPVR	Beta-casein	Bos taurus	208-217	Antithrombotic						An anticoagulant peptide from β-casein identification, structure and molecular mechanism	Liu, H. et al.	Various bioactive peptides are identified from casein hydrolysates. YQEPVLGPVR (PICA), a novel antithrombotic peptide derived from beta-casein (fragment 193-202), was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. The anticoagulation activity assay showed that this peptide has a strong anticoagulant activity. It was proved that the peptide did not interact with the active site of thrombin to inhibit thrombin, and that it inhibited thrombin activity by binding the exosite-1 of thrombin, which was also confirmed by the fibrinogen clotting time assay. It was shown that PICA prolonged fibrinogen clotting time in a dose-dependent manner. Secondary structures of the thrombin-PICA complex were also measured by circular dichroism to prove that PICA can combine with thrombin. Moreover, Discovery Studio 2017 R2 software was used for molecular docking to provide the potential mechanism for the antithrombotic activity of the peptide. These results suggested that PICA probably can be used as an antithrombotic ingredient in the functional food industry.	10.1039/c8fo02235f	sequence	IDENTITY	100.0	1	10	1	10	1.88e-10	10	0	0

Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase).

Milk proteins are considered a reservoir of peptides possessing various bioactivities. Using ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography, antioxidant peptides were purified from crude peptide extract of probiotic yoghurt supplemented with pineapple peel powder stored for 28 days at 4 °C. Two β-casein-derived peptides, 193YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV209 and 69SLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPF87 (designated P17 and P19, respectively), were identified and their antioxidant and anticancer activities assessed.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of a peptide derived from bovine beta-casein (beta-CN), the beta-CN (193-209) peptide, on mouse macrophages that were obtained either from germfree (GF) or from human flora-associated (HF) mice. Macrophages were derived from bone marrow (BMDM) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor and exposed to the peptide or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Membrane marker expression [F4/80, Mac-1, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens] and phagocytic activity were assessed by flow cytometry. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 was measured by bioassays and production of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-12 by ELISA. The expression of cytokine mRNA was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The beta-CN (193-209) peptide up-regulated MHC class II antigen expression and phagocytic activity of BMDM from GF and HF mice. Its enhancing effect on phagocytosis was greater than that after LPS stimulation (P < 0.01). The peptide induced notable levels of cytokine mRNA in BMDM from GF and HF mice, but it was a significantly weaker inducer of cytokine secretion than LPS. Nevertheless, although flora implantation had no stimulatory influence on basal MHC class II and basal cytokine levels, cells from HF mice were more susceptible than those from GF mice to the peptide effects on these variables. These results indicate that the beta-CN (193-209) peptide could enhance antimicrobial activity of macrophages without proinflammatory effects.	10.1093/jn/131.11.2936 	sequence	IDENTITY	82.35	1	14	1	14	5.46e-15	14	0	0

YQKFPQYLQ	P02663	YQKFPQYLQY	Alpha-S2-casein	Bos taurus	104-113	ACE-inhibitory						Identification and characterization of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory peptide derived from bovine casein	Xue, L. et al.	In this study, we identified a novel angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide, YQKFPQYLQY (YQK), derived from bovine casein. Casein was hydrolyzed using pepsin and trypsin. The target peptide, YQK, was separated from the hydrolysate by ultrafiltration and Sephadex G-15chromatography. The IC50 value of YQK was 11.1 μM. YQK retained its ACE inhibitory activity under various temperature and pH conditions. It was also stable against the digestive enzymes pepsin and trypsin. The Lineweaver–Burk plot suggested that the inhibitory mode of YQK was competitive. Furthermore, its antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) also revealed that oral administration of YQK can significantly decrease systolic blood pressure. These results suggested that YQK may have potential applications in functional foods or pharmaceuticals as an antihypertensive agent.	10.1016/j.peptides.2017.09.021	sequence	IDENTITY	90.0	1	9	1	9	4.50e-09	9	0	0

The objective of the present study was to identify antimicrobial peptides present in several digests of commercial caseins with gastric enzymes. The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992 	sequence	IDENTITY	87.5	1	7	2	8	2.16e-06	7	0	0

Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet. They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.	10.3390/antiox9020117	sequence	IDENTITY	80.95	4	20	1	17	1.83e-18	17	0	0
YYQQKPVAL	P02668	YYQQKPVA	Kappa-casein	Bos taurus	63-70	Antimicrobial			log(N0/Nf)	E. coli S. carnosus		Identification of antibacterial peptides from bovine kappa-casein	Lopez-Exposito, I. et al.	The objective of the present study was to identify antimicrobial peptides present in several digests of commercial caseins with gastric enzymes. The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Among the synthesized peptides, kappa-casein f(18-24), f(30-32), and f(139-146) were most effective against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of these peptides is discussed in relation to their amino acid sequences.	10.4315/0362-028x-69.12.2992 	sequence	IDENTITY	88.89	1	8	1	8	8.77e-08	8	0	0
