Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,,,,,,

Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 3) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 4) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively.

In the present study, opioid peptides with agonistic activities for δ-receptor-expressing HEK293 cells were screened from casein hydrolysates prepared with five types of food grade proteolytic enzymes, among which casein hydrolysate with Aspergillus oryzae protease ASD showed the highest opioid activity. Eluted fractions showing potent opioid activity were further purified for active peptides by reverse phase-HPLC. The peptide in the active fraction was identified as YPFPGPIPNS, a member of β-casomorphin (CM-10) (β-casein 60–69). Various CM-10 derivative peptides were synthesized and their characteristic features for specificities towards δ- and μ-receptors were determined. Peptides 5 to 12 amino acids long showed relatively higher opioid activities for δ- and μ-receptors. CM-10 was docked into the optimized δ-receptor model. The CDOCKER energies of the CM-10 derivatives were consistent with their opioid activities. In the elevated plus-maze study, CM-10 showed a significant anti-anxiety effect in BALB/c mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg body weight when administered orally, but not via intravenous injection. Furthermore, intravital imaging revealed that Ca2+ signaling was induced in the small intestinal villi of a Yellow Cameleon 3.60 (YC3.60)-expressing mouse upon injection with CM-10. However, this decreased in the presence of δ- or μ-receptor antagonists. These results suggest that the opioid peptide CM-10 prepared from casein with ASD has an anti-anxiety effect through interaction with gut δ- and/or μ-opioid receptors in the mouse gut.",10.1039/d2fo01793h,sequence,IDENTITY,Antianxiety,11203718.75,25993400.91,131939608.4,116328259,14161655.18,125695068.7

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.",10.3390/antiox9020117,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant; ACE-inhibitory,9679415.438,920501.5183,242319.4297,371158.3204,5299958.478,315941.6529

Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods.",10.3168/jds.2015-10437,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant,1152239.1,461931.1172,,,856392.8215,

Therefore, this study suggests that the specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 offer potential beneficial health effects in the management of hypertension, thrombosis and diabetes.",1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112581; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005,sequence,IDENTITY,DPP-IV Inhibitory,8077116.188,5825224.792,2202614.282,1931650.229,7112019.875,2040035.85

Val-Ala-Pro, the C-terminal tripeptide of CEI5 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro), exhibited more potent inhibitory activity (I50 = 2.0μm) than CEI5 (I50 = 6.0μm). However, d-Val-Ala-Pro showed lower inhibitory activity (I50 = 550μm). Val-Ala-Pro may be important for the inhibitory activity of CEI5. The C-terminal heptapeptide of CEI12 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys) and the short fragments of CEIβ7 (Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg) showed lower inhibitory activities than the full-length peptides.

Also, the antihypertensive activity of CEI12 and CEI5 was investigated. CEI12, intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 14.2 mg/kg, antagonized the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I.; 2) An 8-AA (8mer) fragment (PFPEVFGK) of a known antihypertensive peptide derived from bovine αS1-casein (C12 antihypertensive peptide) was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods.",1) 10.1080/00021369.1987.10868244; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-10437,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant,2682948.911,270011.8294,,,1648833.019,

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats.

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample.

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 2) This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 3) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity.

These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 4) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory; Cytomodulatory; Antioxidant; Antithrombotic,35780431.43,2340170.112,2663785.844,620858.5,21448890.87,1642322.172

Peptides released from Yak milk casein (YMC) have multiple bioactivities, including anti-inflammation and immune-regulation, suggesting that these peptides might be able to inhibit cancer theoretically. However, the anti-cancer peptides from YMC have only been sparsely studied. Breast carcinoma is the most common carcinoma in women worldwide. Thus, the paper herein was to identify yak milk casein (YMC)-derived anti-breast cancer peptides via gel filtration, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) for the first time. The inhibitory effects of the hydrolysates on the cell viabilities, cell cycles and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were evaluated with a cck8 kit and a flow cytometry. The result showed that YMC hydrolysates (YMCH) obtained by united hydrolyzation with trypsin (3 h) and alkaline protease (3 h) displayed the highest cell viability inhibition rate for MCF7 (20.74 ± 1.39%) and MDA-MB-231 (26.73 ± 2.87%) cells. Three peptides were identified in the RP-HPLC subfraction F3-4, and a nonapeptide (TPVVVPPFL) showed the most potent inhibitory effects on both cancer cells and displayed good gastrointestinal stability.

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.",1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antimicrobial; Anticancer; Antithrombotic; Immunomodulatory,,,,,,

Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM.

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.",10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,,660279.25,,,660279.25,

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,9397.573242,249480.697,416309.7227,859594.5784,189459.916,711832.9598

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified was casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of αs1-casein. This product consisted of the N-terminal segment (1–23) of αs1-casein B, named ‘isracidin’, and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest, in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source.",1) 10.1016/0278-6915(95)00097-6; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial; Immunomodulatory,9366826,,1683202.125,1472244.25,9366826,1542563.542

Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate.

In this study, the protein-derived peptide Cp1 was synthesized from bovine αS1-casein, and its potential use as a food biopreservative was indicated by the higher cell selectivity shown by 11-residue peptide towards bacterial cells than human RBCs. It also showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64–640 μM against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The peptide had low hemolytic activity (23.54%, 512 μM) as well as cytotoxicity. The results of fluorescence spectroscopy, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy experiments indicated that Cp1 exerted its activity by permeabilizing the microbial membrane and destroying cell membrane integrity. We found that Cp1 had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, low hemolytic activity, and cytotoxicity. The results also revealed that Cp1 could cause cell death by permeabilizing the cell membrane and disrupting membrane integrity. Overall, the findings presented in this study improve our understanding of the antimicrobial potency of Cp1 and provided evidence of the antimicrobial mechanisms of Cp1. The peptide Cp1 could have potential applications as a food biopreservative.; 2) Bovine casein was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including pepsin, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin and β-chymotrypsin, and assessed for antibacterial activity. The pepsin digest of bovine casein, which showed antibacterial activity, was fractionated using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and the antibacterial peptides isolated were characterised using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. Two antibacterial peptides were identified, a novel peptide (Cp1) which corresponded to residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein and a previously reported peptide (Cp2) which corresponded to residues 183–207 of bovine αS2-casein. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cp1 and Cp2 were determined against a range of bacterial cultures. Cp1 exhibited an MIC of 125 μg mL−1 against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, and MIC ranging between 125 and >1000 μg mL−1 against the Gram-negative bacteria tested. Cp2 was generally far more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria, exhibiting an MIC of 21 μg mL−1, compared to MICs ranging from 332 to >664 μg mL−1 against most of the Gram-negative bacteria tested.; 3) A Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane affinity screening method was developed to separate targeted antimicrobial peptides from the pepsin hydrolyzate of bovine casein. S. cerevisiae cell membranes were first immobilized on the surface of the silica gel to construct an affinity binding medium. A membrane-binding fraction was successfully screened by comparing the RP-HPLC fingerprint chromatograms of the hydrolyzate before and after adsorption with the adsorption medium. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was identified as LRLKKYKVPQL with the use of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer. The sequence corresponded to amino acid residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein. The results indicated that it is feasible to target screen antimicrobial peptides from protein hydrolyzate using S. cerevisiae cell membranes. The influences of thermal treatment, pH, ions, and enzymes on the activity of the purified peptide were also determined. The activity of the peptide was relatively thermally stable and was pH dependent. It retained more than 90% of its activity in the presence of 15% Na+, K+ and pepsin. Trypsin, proteinase K, divalent cation Mg2+ and Ca2+ reduced the activity to different extents. The peptide also showed antibacterial effectiveness in fresh pear juice.

Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM.

Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

The result showed that YMC hydrolysates (YMCH) obtained by united hydrolyzation with trypsin (3 h) and alkaline protease (3 h) displayed the highest cell viability inhibition rate for MCF7 (20.74 ± 1.39%) and MDA-MB-231 (26.73 ± 2.87%) cells. Three peptides were identified in the RP-HPLC subfraction F3-4, and a nonapeptide (TPVVVPPFL) showed the most potent inhibitory effects on both cancer cells and displayed good gastrointestinal stability. TPVVVPPFL could induce G2-M cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells and S cell arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis in both cancer cells. Moreover, in silico analysis indicated that the peptide had non-toxic and no inhibitory roles on P4502D6-enzyme. Together, this study shows that YMC is a good source of anti-breast cancer cells peptides.",10.3389/fnut.2022.997514,sequence,IDENTITY,Anticancer,7083819.469,5486974.433,33362864.08,13402344.93,6399457.311,21956853.14

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm.

In this study, the protein-derived peptide Cp1 was synthesized from bovine αS1-casein, and its potential use as a food biopreservative was indicated by the higher cell selectivity shown by 11-residue peptide towards bacterial cells than human RBCs. It also showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64–640 μM against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The peptide had low hemolytic activity (23.54%, 512 μM) as well as cytotoxicity. The results of fluorescence spectroscopy, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy experiments indicated that Cp1 exerted its activity by permeabilizing the microbial membrane and destroying cell membrane integrity. We found that Cp1 had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, low hemolytic activity, and cytotoxicity. The results also revealed that Cp1 could cause cell death by permeabilizing the cell membrane and disrupting membrane integrity. Overall, the findings presented in this study improve our understanding of the antimicrobial potency of Cp1 and provided evidence of the antimicrobial mechanisms of Cp1. The peptide Cp1 could have potential applications as a food biopreservative.; 2) Bovine casein was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including pepsin, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin and β-chymotrypsin, and assessed for antibacterial activity. The pepsin digest of bovine casein, which showed antibacterial activity, was fractionated using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and the antibacterial peptides isolated were characterised using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. Two antibacterial peptides were identified, a novel peptide (Cp1) which corresponded to residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein and a previously reported peptide (Cp2) which corresponded to residues 183–207 of bovine αS2-casein. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cp1 and Cp2 were determined against a range of bacterial cultures. Cp1 exhibited an MIC of 125 μg mL−1 against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, and MIC ranging between 125 and >1000 μg mL−1 against the Gram-negative bacteria tested. Cp2 was generally far more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria, exhibiting an MIC of 21 μg mL−1, compared to MICs ranging from 332 to >664 μg mL−1 against most of the Gram-negative bacteria tested.; 3) A Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane affinity screening method was developed to separate targeted antimicrobial peptides from the pepsin hydrolyzate of bovine casein. S. cerevisiae cell membranes were first immobilized on the surface of the silica gel to construct an affinity binding medium. A membrane-binding fraction was successfully screened by comparing the RP-HPLC fingerprint chromatograms of the hydrolyzate before and after adsorption with the adsorption medium. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was identified as LRLKKYKVPQL with the use of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer. The sequence corresponded to amino acid residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein. The results indicated that it is feasible to target screen antimicrobial peptides from protein hydrolyzate using S. cerevisiae cell membranes. The influences of thermal treatment, pH, ions, and enzymes on the activity of the purified peptide were also determined. The activity of the peptide was relatively thermally stable and was pH dependent. It retained more than 90% of its activity in the presence of 15% Na+, K+ and pepsin. Trypsin, proteinase K, divalent cation Mg2+ and Ca2+ reduced the activity to different extents. The peptide also showed antibacterial effectiveness in fresh pear juice. These observations provide further information on the application of protein-derived antimicrobial peptides in food systems.",1) 10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.09.030; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.05.005; 3) 10.3390/molecules23051220,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,17516256,,,,17516256,

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.",10.1128/AEM.00096-07,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,5698065.5,1438374.375,,4006295.5,4278168.458,4006295.5

The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity.

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.

These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.",10.1128/AEM.00096-07,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,761778.2932,5845081.792,2464285.904,5500455.353,2940336.935,4199239.874

The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.",10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,112004570,224222544.9,47158688.38,117341627.5,160097987.8,87263225.02

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM).

The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not.

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.; 2) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 3) Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified was casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of αs1-casein. This product consisted of the N-terminal segment (1–23) of αs1-casein B, named ‘isracidin’, and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest, in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source.",1) 10.1016/0278-6915(95)00097-6; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x; 3) 10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial; Immunomodulatory,,,,,,

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample.

The oral administration of CMP (150 mg kg−1) significantly reduced the systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHR. The antihypertensive action was more pronounced when CMP was treated with trypsin. The sequence MAIPPKK, identified in the tryptic hydrolysate of bovine CMP, significantly reduced blood pressure at a dose of 10 mg kg−1. The CMP and its tryptic peptides induced relaxation of endothelium-intact aortic rings. The sequence MAIPPKK also evoked a significant relaxation effect; however, the shorter sequence MAIPPK and the strong ACE-inhibitory tripeptide IPP exhibited a vascular relaxing effect lower than 10%.

In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 2) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 3) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042; 3) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antimicrobial; Immunomodulatory,9536850.602,533148.3125,,,7736110.144,

Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation.

The objective of the study was to analyze the effect of pepsin-treated CMP from cow and goat milk on the resistance of Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus rhamnosus during acid stress. Bacterial cells in the exponential growth phase were suspended in acidified phosphate buffered saline with or without pepsin-treated CMP. Viability was determined during a 90-min incubation period. Pepsin-treated CMP exhibited bactericidal activity at pH 3.5 when added in a dose-dependent manner to E. coli, decreasing survival by more than 90% within 15 min at 0.25 mg/mL. At pH >4.5, the bactericidal activity disappeared, indicating that pepsin-treated CMP was efficient at low pH only. The effectiveness of pepsin-treated CMP at pH 3.5 was not affected by the presence of glycoconjugates linked to CMP or by the bovine or caprine origin of milk. In contrast, L. rhamnosus, a probiotic, was more resistant to acid stress when pepsin-treated bovine or caprine CMP was added to the media. Viability reached 50% after 60 min of incubation at pH 3 compared with 5% survival in the media without added pepsin-treated CMP. Neither glycosylation extent nor sequence variations between CMP from bovine milk and caprine milk affected the protective activity of hydrolyzed CMP toward L. rhamnosus. This suggests that encrypted bioactive peptides released by the pepsin treatment of CMP had an antibacterial effect on E. coli in acidic media, but improved the resistance of L. rhamnosus to acid stress. The peptide fragment accountable for bactericidal activity is the N-terminal region κ-casein f(106-124).",10.3168/jds.2010-4142,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,41172825.5,,,,41172825.5,

To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory,370205.1875,978340.2188,3773521.938,337307.8594,775628.5417,1482712.552

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.",10.3390/antiox9020117,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,792433.6563,735141.0104,182292.0313,330999.8985,758058.0688,281430.6094

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory,8638352.94,42859655.36,74619611.2,101091429.1,23304625.4,89746364.29

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 3) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 4) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 5) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0; 2) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 5) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant,5270891.875,28214284.33,41416036.83,31981237.88,15103774.36,36024723.14

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml.

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.; 4) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 5) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).",1) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,254189.0596,8059226.019,9449908.42,13592161.78,3599204.899,11816910.34

The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 3) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography.

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE).

Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 5) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 6) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 7) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).",1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 6) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 7) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory; DPP-IV Inhibitory; Antianxiety,13127710.32,136636568.2,86566174.13,95046092.59,66060077.97,91411841.82

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography.

Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 5) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter).

The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.; 2) Aims: To isolate and characterize peptides from bovine colostrum with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 3) Apart from immunoglobulin A and G antibodies and plasma cells, milk also contains antibiotic/host protective peptides that are of value not only for maintenance of its nutritional integrity but also for protection of the newborn and, possibly, protection of the lactating mother. Among the first such peptides identified was casecidin; following chymosin digestion of casein at pH 6 or 7, casecidin inhibited in vitro staphylococci, sarcina, Bacillus subtilis, Diplococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Inhibition occurred at high concentrations, in vitro, compared with commercial antibiotics, and thus interest in casecidin languished. Work with casecidin was followed by investigation of a related refined non-immunogenic product of chymosin digestion of αs1-casein. This product consisted of the N-terminal segment (1–23) of αs1-casein B, named ‘isracidin’, and was significantly effective in vivo at concentrations that were competitive with known antibiotics, as seen in the protection of mice against lethal infection by Staphylococcus aureus strain Smith. Field trials showed that injection of isracidin into the udder gave protection against mastitis in sheep and cows. Isracidin was both therapeutic and prophylactic and responses to its therapeutic effect produced long-term immune resistance. Isracidin protected mice against Candida albicans, by stimulation of both phagocytosis and immune responses. However, like other recently described milk-derived peptides, despite its clinical value, isracidin was overlooked because of the lack of commercial interest, in the 1970s and early 1980s, in host-mediated non-specific resistance as a therapeutic approach to infection. Another problem that impeded commercial interest was the isomeric variation in isracidin peptides seen on large-scale batch production for commercial use. It is hoped that this review of previous studies of the activity of isracidin action will revive interest in milk as an antibiotic source.",1) 10.1016/0278-6915(95)00097-6; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x; 3) 10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial; Immunomodulatory,,,,,,

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus.

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not.

Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion. In contrast, after simulated digestion, the activities of peptides VRYL and KKYNVPQL decreased.

The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively.

The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.; 2) Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.; 3) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins or artificial synthetic products. Further research examining the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods. Our research also demonstrates that ACE inhibitory peptide LAP may lower blood pressure with no adverse effects.; 4) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.

Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively.

Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods.",1) 10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-10437; 3) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.098; 4) 10.1021/jf049510t; 5) 10.1080/00021369.1982.10865255,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant,60450198.07,2488616.224,435811.3229,396370.7812,35609520.14,413273.8705

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 3) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 3) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,5419791.104,15088295.33,242904.1094,3141883.063,10254043.22,2175556.745

The results suggest that the isolated bioactive peptides act on conversion and/or inactivation of endogenous peptides by enzymes such as angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase by modifying several systemic responses such as blood-pressure regulation and in pain response.",10.1023/b:jopc.0000008724.98339.ff,sequence,IDENTITY,Bradykinin-Potentiating,26981805.5,1427208.872,1573426.813,3437512.584,7815858.029,2505469.698

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.",1) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005,sequence,IDENTITY,DPP-IV Inhibitory; Opioid; Bradykinin-Potentiating; Antimicrobial; Antioxidant; Increase mucin secretion,13800805.75,555396.125,860199.7317,1567405.516,7178100.938,1213802.624

All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.; 2) Opioid antagonists were sought in the fragments of κ-casein which were obtained by chemical synthesis and enzymic digestion. A synthetic bovine κ-casein peptide (35–41), Tyr-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Asn (casoxin A) showed opioid antagonist activity at 200 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. A synthetic peptide Tyr-Pro-Tyr-Tyr (casoxin B) which is found in bovine and human κ-casein, also showed opioid antagonist activity at 100 μM. Another opioid antagonist peptide (casoxin C) was isolated from tryptic digests of bovine κ-casein by reverse-phase HPLC. The structure of the peptide was Tyr-Ile-Pro-Ile-Gln-Tyr-Val-Leu-Ser-Arg, which corresponded to κ-casein (25–34). Casoxin C was active at 5 μM in the guinea pig ileum assay. Thus, bovine κ-casein contains three potential opioid antagonist sequences.",1) 10.1017/s0022029900028818; 2) 10.1007/BF02019390,sequence,IDENTITY,Opioid; DPP-IV Inhibitory,3380230.898,10428352.25,1339865.625,14378222.88,6400854.335,9162879.975

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE).

The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 4) Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 5) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively.

Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 4) Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 5) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively.

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of several infant formulas was evaluated. Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119).

The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced.

It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively.

Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.02.011; 2) 10.3390/foods9080991,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Increase mucin secretion; Opioid; Antianxiety; Anticancer; Immunomodulatory; Satiety; Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory,463776701.8,2610471619,1132095819,2379199431,1383788809,1844726454

To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared. One standard, one extensively hydrolyzed, and one partially hydrolyzed infant formula were digested in vitro with pepsin and pancreatin, taking into account the higher gastric pH of infants, and the digesta were subjected to peptidomic analysis. The standard formula released a larger variety of bioactive peptides than from the hydrolyzed formulas, indicating that industrial hydrolysis of milk proteins may generally attenuate their indigenous bioactivities such as antibacterial, immuno-regulatory, and anti-oxidative activities. Conversely, industrial hydrolysis may facilitate the formation of bioactive peptides from hydrophobic proteins/regions such as β-LG and the “strategic zone” of β-CN, which encrypt bioactive peptides including a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4-inhibitory, hypocholesterolemic, and opioid peptides.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains.

The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 4) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 3) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Immunomodulatory; Antithrombotic,1421888.555,61719.00586,25073.4043,81454.6354,741803.7803,67359.32762

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 4) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control.

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity.

Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 4) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 5) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 5) 10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antimicrobial; Immunomodulatory; Cytomodulatory; Antioxidant; Antithrombotic,86153494.31,5802297.375,7302208.813,1382856.875,51717267.05,4342532.844

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,14126839.08,1337397.495,197111.1621,960622.3925,7732118.289,706118.649

The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.; 3) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm.

It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 2) 10.1016/S0141-0229(97)00261-5,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,30900.64258,315374.3535,1174101.995,823825.2786,220549.7832,998963.6367

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 5) Qula casein derived from yak milk was hydrolysed using various enzymes. Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 6) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 7) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 8) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).",1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008; 4) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0; 5) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003; 6) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 7) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 8) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory; DPP-IV Inhibitory; Antianxiety,18976578,16722882.75,49498682.96,24280343.5,18010708.61,35088203.27

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively.

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 4) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 5) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 6) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory,29943384.63,24596247.5,117482471.6,72039757.6,27651754.43,91515206.45

This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.; 2) Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.",1) 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.05.004; 2) 10.1017/S0022029914000533,sequence,IDENTITY,Increase mucin secretion; Opioid; Wound healing,693829.6487,133663.4219,,147792.3125,507107.5731,147792.3125

Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,,4774926.742,4291163.639,3054665.984,4774926.742,3549265.046

The antioxidant potential of the identified peptide was also evaluated in a model of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in the IEC-6 cell line. The peptide was able to reduce ROS release, while, on the other hand, it increased nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) activation and the expression of antioxidant cytoprotective factors, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). These results indicate that buffalo ricotta cheese-isolated peptide could have potential in the treatment of some gastrointestinal disorders.",10.3390/ijms19071955,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,5858535,,,,5858535,

Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.",10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant; Antimicrobial; ACE-inhibitory,,,962960.75,966693.0159,,964826.883

In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.",10.3390/antiox9020117,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,18883327.73,780399.875,,22760980,11642156.59,22760980

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) The aim of this study was to investigate the multifunctional properties of specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 on the inhibition of enzymes involved in hypertension (ACE), type 2 diabetes (DPP-IV) and thrombosis (thrombin). Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities. Also, in silico analysis was employed for the prediction of sequences after digestion. Results showed that peptide inhibitory activities on ACE, DPP-IV and thrombin were enhanced after digestion. After in vitro digestion, peptide NAVPITPTLN showed the best efficiency to inhibit DPP-IV. Likewise, NAVPITPTLN and QEPVLGPVRGPFIIV showed high thrombin inhibitory activities, and HPHPHLSFMAIPP and SLPQNIPPL presented high ACE inhibitory activities. In vitro and in silico studies indicated that these peptides are precursors of multifunctional peptide sequences. Therefore, this study suggests that the specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 offer potential beneficial health effects in the management of hypertension, thrombosis and diabetes.",1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112581; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005,sequence,IDENTITY,DPP-IV Inhibitory,1747914.372,10762207.35,12820094.09,6355050.792,5611182.789,9587572.441

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals.

The αs1-casein tryptic hydrolysate containing this peptide decreases stress effects after oral administration in various species including man. Therefore, the stability of this peptide toward gastric and pancreatic proteases has been assessed by using pepsin, chymotrypsin/trypsin, Corolase PP, pepsin followed by chymotrypsin/trypsin or pepsin followed by Corolase PP. α-Casozepine was slowly degraded by chymotrypsin, much more sensitive to pepsin and Corolase PP but not completely destroyed after 4 h kinetics. The bonds in the region 91 to 95 of the α-casozepine were totally resistant to hydrolysis by all studied proteases. Surprisingly, a fragment, corresponding to the sequence 91−97 and found in all the hydrolysis media in significant amount, possessed an anxiolytic activity in three behavioral tests measuring this parameter. This peptide could participate in the in vivo activity of α-casozepine.; 2) α-Casozepine and f91–97, peptides from αs1-casein, display anxiolytic activity in rats and may have to cross the intestinal epithelium to exert this central effect. We evaluated their resistance to hydrolysis by the peptidases of Caco-2 cells and their ability to cross the cell monolayer. To mimic physiological conditions, two preparations of bile salts were used in noncytotoxic concentrations: porcine bile extract and an equimolar mixture of taurocholate, cholate, and deoxycholate. The presence and composition of bile salts appeared to modulate the peptidase activities of the Caco-2 cells involved (i) in the hydrolysis of α-casozepine, leading to much higher formation of fragments f91–99, f91–98, and f91–97, and (ii) in the hydrolysis of f91–97, leading to lower degradation of this peptide. Transport of α-casozepine across Caco-2 monolayer increased significantly, in the presence of bile extract, and of fragment f91–97, in the presence of bile salts.",1) 10.1021/jf104089c; 2) 10.1021/jf202890e,sequence,IDENTITY,Antianxiety; Anticancer; Antioxidant,,,,,,

However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins or artificial synthetic products. Further research examining the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods. Our research also demonstrates that ACE inhibitory peptide LAP may lower blood pressure with no adverse effects.; 3) Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.; 4) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 5) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.02.005; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 5) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Immunomodulatory,204318239.8,199449740.1,121729661.9,155687877.3,202370839.9,144368472.1

Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.",10.4014/jmb.2104.04013,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,,,,,,

Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.",10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,531013.7708,1782587.49,6406940.15,2173390.619,1156800.63,3987768.99

The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates.

Peptides released from Yak milk casein (YMC) have multiple bioactivities, including anti-inflammation and immune-regulation, suggesting that these peptides might be able to inhibit cancer theoretically. However, the anti-cancer peptides from YMC have only been sparsely studied. Breast carcinoma is the most common carcinoma in women worldwide. Thus, the paper herein was to identify yak milk casein (YMC)-derived anti-breast cancer peptides via gel filtration, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) for the first time. The inhibitory effects of the hydrolysates on the cell viabilities, cell cycles and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were evaluated with a cck8 kit and a flow cytometry. The result showed that YMC hydrolysates (YMCH) obtained by united hydrolyzation with trypsin (3 h) and alkaline protease (3 h) displayed the highest cell viability inhibition rate for MCF7 (20.74 ± 1.39%) and MDA-MB-231 (26.73 ± 2.87%) cells. Three peptides were identified in the RP-HPLC subfraction F3-4, and a nonapeptide (TPVVVPPFL) showed the most potent inhibitory effects on both cancer cells and displayed good gastrointestinal stability. TPVVVPPFL could induce G2-M cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells and S cell arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis in both cancer cells.

DPP-IV inhibitors have emerged as new and promising oral agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of β-lactoglobulin as natural source of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. A whey protein concentrate rich in β-lactoglobulin was hydrolysed with trypsin and fractionated using a chromatographic separation at semipreparative scale. Two of the six collected fractions showed notable DPP-IV inhibitory activity. These fractions were analysed by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) to identify peptides responsible for the observed activity. The most potent fragment (IPAVF) corresponded to β-lactoglobulin f(78–82) which IC50 value was 44.7 μM. The results suggest that peptides derived from β-lactoglobulin would be beneficial ingredients of foods against type 2 diabetes.; 2) Whey proteins are rich sources of bioactive peptides which may play a role in the dietary management of chronic diseases. Fractionation via ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the enrichment of antioxidant, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in a tryptic hydrolysate of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg TH). UF processing selectively enhanced the biofunctional properties of β-Lg TH with the permeate obtained using a 1 kDa polyethersulfone (HFP-1) membrane having highest in vitro multifunctional bioactivity. Compared to β-Lg TH, the antioxidant activity was 1.7-fold higher (46,765 ± 2504 vs. 77,251 ± 5124 µmol Trolox equivalent/100 g dw; P < 0.05), DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) decreased threefold (1.6 ± 0.31 vs. 0.53 ± 0.05 mg/mL; P < 0.05) and there was a twofold reduction in ACE IC50 (0.131 ± 0.005 vs. 0.068 ± 0.018 mg/mL; P < 0.05). The multifunctional peptide VAGTWY, β-Lg f(15–20) was shown to have potent antioxidant activity (5.63 µmol TE/µmol peptide). Two new ACE inhibitory peptides, IIAEK and IPAVFK, having IC50 values of 63.7 ± 7.22 and 144.8 ± 25.3 μM, respectively, were also identified in β-Lg TH.

Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures.

Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein.

The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced. It corresponded to the β-casein fragment 58-72.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm.

The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.; 4) Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 5) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps.

It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 4) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products.

The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.; 5) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2.

In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control.

Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures.

Macedocin was produced when the strain was grown in milk but not in MRS or M17 broth. No autoinduction mechanism was observed. Production did not depend on the presence of lactose or galactose in the culture medium or on a coculture of the producer strain with macedocin-sensitive or macedocin-resistant strains. Induction seemed to depend on the presence of one or more heat-stable protein components produced when S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was grown in milk. The partial purification of the induction factor was performed by a combination of chromatography methods, and its activity was confirmed by a reverse transcription-PCR approach (RT-PCR). Mass spectrometric (MS) and tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analyses of an induction-active fraction showed the presence of several peptides of low molecular mass corresponding to fragments of αS1- and β-casein as well as β-lactoglobulin. The chemically synthesized αS1-casein fragment 37-55 (2,253.65 Da) was proven to be able to induce macedocin biosynthesis.

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight.

ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.; 2) Inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme were isolated from an enzymatic hydrolysate of bovine casein. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro- Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys (CEI12), Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (CEI5), and Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg (CEIβ7). CEI5 is a penta-peptide derived from the hydrolysate of CEI12 with proline-specific endopeptidase, and CEIβ7 is a hepta-peptide derived from β-casein.

The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 2) This work evaluated the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities of a bovine sodium caseinate fermentate generated using the proteolytic capabilities of the porcine small intestinal isolate Lactobacillus animalis DPC6134 (NCIMB deposit 41355). The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 3) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.",1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antimicrobial; Immunomodulatory; Anticancer; Antithrombotic,,,,1368854.125,,1368854.125

The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.",10.1128/AEM.01394-13,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,,,,,,

Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.; 4) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 3) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Cytomodulatory,172457.3086,16061150.42,871588.0054,4817805.735,12088977.14,3126569.565

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,35644863.52,8761845.083,,5833181.796,22203354.3,5833181.796

On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.",10.1021/jf049510t,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,,,,,,

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,160097.1849,344312.9766,,135928.1406,233783.5016,135928.1406

Therefore, proliferation changes were followed up after incorporation of BrdU into the DNA, and the influence on protein biosynthesis was measured using the [3H]leucine incorporation test. Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly significantly enhanced (maximal 90 and 35%, respectively) the proliferation of PBL. For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly. The findings point to a need for further studies on the possible function of peptides derived from milk proteins as orally bioavailable immunopotentiatory compounds.; 2) Antioxidants having anti-inflammatory potential will be useful in reducing the progression of many lifestyle associated diseases. Under present investigation, buffalo casein derived decapeptide (YQEPVLGPVR) displayed anti-inflammatory response by suppressed (p < 0.01) murine splenocytes proliferation, reduced inflammatory cytokine levels (Interferon-γ) besides elevated levels of regulatory cytokines (Interleukin-10 and Transforming Growth Factor-β) in splenocyte culture supernatant. Decapeptide also improved the phagocytosis (p < 0.01) of peritoneal macrophages. Subsequently, antioxidative feature of the peptide was also identified by efficient (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging using chemical assays (ABTS: 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid and ORAC: oxygen radical absorption capacity methods) which was later confirmed for protective action against H2O2 mediated oxidative stress on intestinal epithelial cells by inhibition (p < 0.01) of cellular ROS generation, oxidative products formation along with elevated (p < 0.01) activities of antioxidative enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase). Declined (p < 0.01) mRNA expression of a transcription factor (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor: Nrf-2) involved in redox signalling further established the protective effect of peptide against oxidative stress induced injury",1) 10.1016/0014-5793(96)00207-4; 2) 10.1007/s10989-018-9708-7,sequence,IDENTITY,Immunomodulatory; Cytomodulatory; ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Antithrombotic,197879323.6,233837880,117577977.4,31383276,213290133.5,74480626.7

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 3) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.; 4) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 5) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 4) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 5) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory; Antioxidant; Antithrombotic; Cytomodulatory,19377908.72,1704600.073,5018545.031,1569700.563,10541254.4,3868930.209

The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown.

These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.; 3) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 4) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,308138.8438,,,,308138.8438,

Among the identified sequences, 24 peptides derived from α-lactalbumin and 11 from β-lactoglobulin were synthesized and their effects on DPP-IV activity assessed. The most potent fragments, LKPTPEGDL and LKPTPEGDLEIL (IC50 = 45 and 57 μM, respectively), were found to inhibit DPP-IV in an un-competitive manner. Although several of the peptides tested showed some inhibitory activity, only two were as effective as the un-fractionated WPI hydrolysate and none were as potent as the un-fractionated α-lactalbumin hydrolysate.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM.

To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.",10.3390/antiox9020117,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,166754.4635,,,,166754.4635,

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.

However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49).

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,921322.7541,3978061.092,611384.5052,683210.8526,2231353.47,652428.1323

Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox. From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively). The latter sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of the ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein molecule, also had antioxidant activity. The activity found is discussed in relation to the peptide sequences.

A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs.

Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity; 2) The antihypertensive effect of the bovine casein-derived peptide Met-Lys-Pro (MKP) was examined in vitro and in vivo. MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.; 3) Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a peptidyldipeptide hydrolase (EC 3.4.15.1) which cleaves dipeptides from the Jree COOH-terminal of peptides. The enzyme hydrolyzes both angiotensin I and bradykinin, generating the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II fiom angiotensin I, and vasoinactive peptides from the vasodilator bradykinin. Inhibitors of ACE were first obtained from the venom of snakes such as Bothrops jararacal ) and Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii) Later, Oshima et a/. found peptide inhibitors of ACE in digests of gelafin with bacterial collagenase) A characteristic of these inhibitors is that they have a Pro-Pro, Ala-Pro or Ala-Hyp sequence at their COOH-terminal.

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant,841873.0625,,,,841873.0625,

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity; 2) The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox. From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively).

However, the single bioactive peptides responsible for the effects of CPPs have not been identified. This study was to purify calcium-binding peptides from CPPs and to determine their effects on calcium and magnesium uptake by Caco-2 cell monolayers. Five monomer peptides designated P1 to P5 were isolated and the amino acid sequences were determined using LC-MS/MS. Compared with the CPP-free control, all five monomeric peptides exhibited significant enhancing effects on the uptake of calcium and magnesium (P < 0.05). Interestingly, when calcium and magnesium were presented simultaneously with P5, magnesium was taken up with priority over calcium in the Caco-2 cell monolayers. For example, at 180 min, the amount of transferred magnesium and calcium was 78.4 ± 0.95 μg/well and 2.56 ± 0.64 μg/well, respectively, showing a more than 30-fold difference in the amount of transport caused by P5.

Furthermore, we provided evidence about a cross-reaction, also in the T47D human breast cancer cell line, of μ-acting opioids with type-II somatostatin receptors. Since a potential source of opioid activity in the breast might be casomorphin peptides (produced by the enzymatic degradation of α-casein and β-casein), we investigated the antiproliferative action of five different casomorphin peptides: α-casein-(90–95), α-casein-(90–96), β-casomorphin, β-casomorphin-(1–5) and morphiceptin. We show that all five peptides decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, cell proliferation. The general antagonist diprenorphine produced only a partial reversal of their action. Furthermore, we provide evidence that all peptides (except for morphiceptin) bind to δ- and κ-opioid binding sites of T47D cells with different selectivity.

In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 2) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.; 2) Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5).

The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods.",1) 10.1080/00021369.1987.10868244; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-10437,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,36432627.08,16611155.75,327816.1563,,27937710.79,327816.1563

Val-Ala-Pro, the C-terminal tripeptide of CEI5 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro), exhibited more potent inhibitory activity (I50 = 2.0μm) than CEI5 (I50 = 6.0μm). However, d-Val-Ala-Pro showed lower inhibitory activity (I50 = 550μm). Val-Ala-Pro may be important for the inhibitory activity of CEI5. The C-terminal heptapeptide of CEI12 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys) and the short fragments of CEIβ7 (Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg) showed lower inhibitory activities than the full-length peptides.

Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 2) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",1) 10.1016/j.jff.2017.03.008; 2) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Anticancer; DPP-IV Inhibitory; Immunomodulatory,244433992.7,611909387.9,323883129.5,569268666.1,401923447.8,464103436.1

Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively.

In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.; 2) Milk is a nutritionally important source of bioactive peptides with anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. These compounds can be useful as ingredients of functional food. For this reason, in the last decades, bioactive peptides attracted the interest of researchers and food companies. In this work, the results obtained with six milk-derived bioactive peptides (Y-4-R, V-6-R, V-7-K, A-10-F, R-10-M, and H-9-M) synthesized and studied for their antioxidant properties in vitro and in a cellular model, are reported. These molecules correspond to peptide fragments derived from parent compounds able to cross the apical membrane of Caco-2 cell layer and released in the basolateral compartment. In vitro, antioxidant tests such as 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) and crocin bleaching showed antioxidant activity mainly for peptides Y-4-R and V-6-R, respectively. In Caco-2 cells, peptides V-6-R, H-9-R, Y-4-R, and particularly R-10-M and V-7-K are able to prevent the decrease of viability due to oxidative stress. The latter peptide is also the most effective in protecting cells from lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, the reported hydrolyzed peptides are shown to exert the antioxidant properties both in vitro and in a cellular model.",1) 10.1002/psc.3162; 2) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,57364.9961,365005.7969,78062.61981,101882.182,211185.3965,89972.40089

As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.; 2) In this study we evaluated the short-term oral antihypertensive effect of several peptide sequences isolated from casein fractions, previously characterized as in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the rats were measured by the tail cuff method before administration and also 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h post-administration. The sequences LVYPFTGPIPN, HLPLP, IAK, YAKPVA and WQVLPNAVPAK showed a clear decrease in SBP and DBP in SHR. HPHPHLSF caused a significant decrease of the DBP in the SHR, but this sequence did not modify the SBP of these animals in a significant manner. KKYNVPQL did not modify SBP in the SHR, and caused a slight, but significant and maintained, decrease in DBP in these animals. SBP and DBP returned to baseline values 24 h post-administration of all peptides. In conclusion, these peptides are bioactive ingredients with potential benefit in the prevention and treatment of hypertension or other associated disorders.",1) 10.1002/mnfr.200900448; 2) 10.1002/elps.200700324,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Osteoanabolic,9911034.422,,,1117561,9911034.422,1117561

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,13934317.81,7802588.625,,9184901.625,11890408.08,9184901.625

These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Autofocusing, as a simple and safe technique, was used to fractionate casein hydrolysate based on the amphoteric nature of its peptides. The antibacterial activity of casein hydrolysate and its autofocusing fractions (A1–10) was examined against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The basic fraction A9 exhibited the highest activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 μg/mL, whereas casein hydrolysate showed MIC values ranging from 2000 to 8000 μg/mL. The antibacterial peptides in A9 were purified by using a series of size exclusion and reversed phase chromatographies. Three peptides exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity with MIC values ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. These peptides were generated from αs2-casein, αs1-casein, and κ-casein and identified as K165KISQRYQKFALPQYLKTVYQHQK188, I6KHQGLPQEV15, and T136EAVESTVATL146, respectively. Therefore, the results revealed that casein hydrolysate had potent antibacterial peptides that could be isolated by autofocusing technique. © 2012 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.; 3) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 4) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

Significance and impact of the study: This study highlights the potential to exploit Bacillus sp. or the enzymes they produce for the generation of bioactive antimicrobial peptides from bovine casein.",1) 10.1128/AEM.07312-11; 2) 10.1002/biof.1023; 3) 10.1128/AEM.72.3.2260-2264.2006; 4) 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03271.x,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,1631956.75,191937.8906,,,1151950.464,

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides.

To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,88635048.53,244082096.3,1497007.098,219464653.8,166358572.4,110480830.4

The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown.

Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.; 2) Due to their beneficial properties, fermented foods are considered important constituents of the human diet.

The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.",10.1128/AEM.01394-13,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,,406061.2813,,,406061.2813,

These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 3) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.; 2) An 8-AA (8mer) fragment (PFPEVFGK) of a known antihypertensive peptide derived from bovine αS1-casein (C12 antihypertensive peptide) was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid-phase peptide synthesis and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Its ability to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was assessed and compared with that of the parent 12mer peptide (FFVAPFPEVFGK) to determine the effect of truncating the sequence on overall hypotensive activity. The activity of the truncated 8mer peptide was found to be almost 1.5 times less active than that of the 12mer, with ACE-inhibiting IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values of 108 and 69 μM, for the 8mer and 12mer, respectively. Although the 8mer peptide is less active than the original 12mer peptide, its overall activity is comparable to activities reported for other small proteins that elicit physiological responses within humans. These results suggest that microbial degradation of the 12mer peptide would not result in a complete loss of antihypertensive activity if used to supplement fermented foods and that the stable 8mer peptide could have potential as a blood pressure–lowering agent for use in functional foods.",1) 10.1021/jf049510t; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-10437,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,23142045.6,1953804.771,776303.0259,584808.209,14061370.96,666877.4162

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample.

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample.

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample.

Methods and Results: Three peptides were purified from fresh colostrum by a range of chromatographic methods using antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli DH5α to screen for the most active fractions. Two peptides, with antimicrobial activity, casecidin 17 and casecidin 15, were identical to sequences in the C‐terminal of bovine β‐casein (YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV and YQEPVLGPVRGPFPI) and had corresponding molecular masses of 1881·00 and 1669·06 Da, respectively. The third peptide was the known peptide isracidin which has a mass of 2763·80 Da and sequence of RPKHPIKHQGLPQEVLNENLLRF. Casecidin 17 and casecidin 15 had identical minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) against E. coli DPC6053 of 0·4 mg ml−1. Structural modelling suggested amphiphilic structures having identical inhibitory and structural properties. The MIC value of isracidin against E. coli DPC6053 was 0·2 mg ml−1.

Conclusions: This study shows the presence of three antimicrobial peptides in colostrum which may contribute to a bioprotective role to limit pathogen contamination. Furthermore, the discovery of casecidin 17 and 15 may provide the basis for novel antimicrobial peptide design.

Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterize peptides with antimicrobial activity present in fresh bovine colostrum.; 2) Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.",1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1111/j.1365-2672.2008.03996.x,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial; ACE-inhibitory,3952974.5,,,,3952974.5,

Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 3) Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 4) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 2) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 3) 10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory; Antioxidant; Antithrombotic,8272336.156,159100.4844,,157774.5606,6649689.022,157774.5606

The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed.

The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.; 2) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins or artificial synthetic products. Further research examining the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods. Our research also demonstrates that ACE inhibitory peptide LAP may lower blood pressure with no adverse effects.; 3) Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.; 4) An optimal antihypertensive peptide (AHP), KVLPVP, was linked to form a six-copy of tandem dotetracontapeptide with the specific cleavage site (Arg-X) of clostripain. The gene of the dotetracontapeptide was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. After a 5 h induction with 1.2 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside the recombinant AHP fused with glutathione-S-transferase tag reached the maximal production, 24.6% of total intracellular protein. Following digestion with clostripain and carboxypeptidase B, the product was separated with ultrafiltration and reversed-phase HPLC, and 170 mg of pure recombinant AHP was obtained from 1 L of E. coli culture. The IC50 of the recombinant AHP was 4.6 microM. The systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats could be decreased dramatically by the recombinant AHP in a dose-dependent manner after delivering 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of body weight (BW) or 0.6 mg of AHP/kg of BW orally. The strong antihypertensive effect was reached 4-24 h after oral administration of 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of BW, and the peak point was at the fourth hour (-21.4 +/- 7.2 mm of Hg). This study overcame traditional enzymatic digestion problems in preparing AHP and established a novel approach for industrial production of AHP.; 5) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 6) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1; 2) 10.1021/jf0703248; 3) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.121; 4) 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.02.005; 5) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976; 6) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Immunomodulatory; Osteoanabolic; Antiapoptotic effect; Antimicrobial; Wound healing; Cholesterol regulation,719366713.3,365531446.3,583481146.9,726746731,567723027.4,665347194.9

The target bacteria were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (both pathogenic), Lactobacillus casei, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (both probiotic). Eight of the peptides (βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14) exhibited antibacterial activity, with βC8, βC12, and βC14 being the most active. The plasmin digest of bovine β-casein was found to be one of the best compounds in terms of antibacterial potential. Measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) revealed the Gram-positive bacteria to be generally more sensitive to antibacterial activity than the Gram-negative bacteria. The eight antibacterial peptides were identified using LC-Mass. The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.",10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial; Antioxidant,148993.8633,,,,148993.8633,

The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity.

The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.; 2) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension.

From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion.

From 11 peptides, which were selected based on their structures, only two, VRYL and KKYNVPQL, showed considerable ACE-inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 24.1 and 77.1 μm, respectively. Subsequently, the impact of the gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity was evaluated. Some of the peptides selected were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with a pancreatic extract. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion did not change drastically except for peptide αs2-CN f(195-204) (TQPKTNAIPY) that exhibited an activity 6 times greater after simulated digestion.

The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.",10.1017/S0007114511001085,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,12486531.75,1209649.75,5941648.271,4820996.875,6848090.75,5493387.713

All the bioactive sequences are hidden in an inactive state inside the polypeptide chain of the larger protein. Milk proteins are a rich source of biologically active peptides such as exorphins (casomorphins), phosphopeptides and immunopeptides. Such peptides are released during intestinal digestion of caseins and whey proteins. They may be involved in regulation of nutrient entry and influence the postprandial metabolism via stimulation of the secretion of hormones. Furthermore, they may exert a stimulating effect on the immune system. These findings offer new aspects for evaluating the nutritive value of food proteins. Moreover, bioactive peptides have already found interesting applications as dietary supplements and as pharmaceutical preparations.; 2) Recently, some physiological significance of peptide fragments derived from milk proteins has been suggested. 1) It has recently been reported that synthetic peptide inhibitors of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP) possibly act as anti-amnestic agents. 2 ) In our previous paper,3) we described the synthesis of a number of peptide fragments of human β-casein, and found that PEP activity was inhibited by the synthetic pep tides within amino acid redidues 49-59 (Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-Glu-Pro-Ile-Pro-Tyr) of β-casein, and the most potent inhibitor was Ile-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Val-GluPro-Ile (50-57, IC50 = 8 11M)",1) 10.1007/BF02019390; 2) 10.1271/bbb.56.976,sequence,IDENTITY,Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory; ACE-inhibitory,121193194,21803059.75,,36100341.5,54933104.5,36100341.5

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.",10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,208283.8711,16266.91309,,379680.7813,144278.2184,379680.7813

The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.",10.1128/AEM.01394-13,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,73797784,85278868,,,79538326,

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,,,,,,

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory,637424.9551,339852.0104,912762.245,514679.8273,509893.6931,685286.5777

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats.

Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49).

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.",10.3390/antiox9020117,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant; ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory,,,,,,

Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis.

Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals.

The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82.

Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed.

Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.",10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,,470161.75,308653.5625,762809.625,470161.75,535731.5938

ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.; 2) Inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme were isolated from an enzymatic hydrolysate of bovine casein. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro- Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys (CEI12), Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (CEI5), and Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg (CEIβ7). CEI5 is a penta-peptide derived from the hydrolysate of CEI12 with proline-specific endopeptidase, and CEIβ7 is a hepta-peptide derived from β-casein. These inhibitors potentiated bradykinin in the contraction of the uterus and the ileum of rats. The ileum was more sensitive to these inhibitors than the uterus. The bradykinin-potentiating activity of these inhibitors on the ileum lasted for more than 90 min even after washing the organ.",1) 10.1080/00021369.1985.10866901; 2) 10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antimicrobial; Antioxidant,30930329.12,47179.73177,,5986770.875,17694693.67,5986770.875

Peptides released from Yak milk casein (YMC) have multiple bioactivities, including anti-inflammation and immune-regulation, suggesting that these peptides might be able to inhibit cancer theoretically. However, the anti-cancer peptides from YMC have only been sparsely studied. Breast carcinoma is the most common carcinoma in women worldwide. Thus, the paper herein was to identify yak milk casein (YMC)-derived anti-breast cancer peptides via gel filtration, reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) for the first time. The inhibitory effects of the hydrolysates on the cell viabilities, cell cycles and apoptosis of breast cancer cells were evaluated with a cck8 kit and a flow cytometry. The result showed that YMC hydrolysates (YMCH) obtained by united hydrolyzation with trypsin (3 h) and alkaline protease (3 h) displayed the highest cell viability inhibition rate for MCF7 (20.74 ± 1.39%) and MDA-MB-231 (26.73 ± 2.87%) cells. Three peptides were identified in the RP-HPLC subfraction F3-4, and a nonapeptide (TPVVVPPFL) showed the most potent inhibitory effects on both cancer cells and displayed good gastrointestinal stability. TPVVVPPFL could induce G2-M cell cycle arrest in MCF7 cells and S cell arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells and induce apoptosis in both cancer cells. Moreover, in silico analysis indicated that the peptide had non-toxic and no inhibitory roles on P4502D6-enzyme. Together, this study shows that YMC is a good source of anti-breast cancer cells peptides.",10.3389/fnut.2022.997514,sequence,IDENTITY,Anticancer,135346976.3,19953390,9450851.875,10578878.13,85892582.14,10095438.3

In this study, the protein-derived peptide Cp1 was synthesized from bovine αS1-casein, and its potential use as a food biopreservative was indicated by the higher cell selectivity shown by 11-residue peptide towards bacterial cells than human RBCs. It also showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 64–640 μM against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The peptide had low hemolytic activity (23.54%, 512 μM) as well as cytotoxicity. The results of fluorescence spectroscopy, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy experiments indicated that Cp1 exerted its activity by permeabilizing the microbial membrane and destroying cell membrane integrity. We found that Cp1 had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, low hemolytic activity, and cytotoxicity. The results also revealed that Cp1 could cause cell death by permeabilizing the cell membrane and disrupting membrane integrity. Overall, the findings presented in this study improve our understanding of the antimicrobial potency of Cp1 and provided evidence of the antimicrobial mechanisms of Cp1. The peptide Cp1 could have potential applications as a food biopreservative.; 2) Bovine casein was hydrolysed with a range of proteolytic enzymes including pepsin, trypsin, α-chymotrypsin and β-chymotrypsin, and assessed for antibacterial activity. The pepsin digest of bovine casein, which showed antibacterial activity, was fractionated using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and the antibacterial peptides isolated were characterised using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. Two antibacterial peptides were identified, a novel peptide (Cp1) which corresponded to residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein and a previously reported peptide (Cp2) which corresponded to residues 183–207 of bovine αS2-casein. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Cp1 and Cp2 were determined against a range of bacterial cultures. Cp1 exhibited an MIC of 125 μg mL−1 against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, and MIC ranging between 125 and >1000 μg mL−1 against the Gram-negative bacteria tested. Cp2 was generally far more potent against the Gram-positive bacteria, exhibiting an MIC of 21 μg mL−1, compared to MICs ranging from 332 to >664 μg mL−1 against most of the Gram-negative bacteria tested.; 3) A Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell membrane affinity screening method was developed to separate targeted antimicrobial peptides from the pepsin hydrolyzate of bovine casein. S. cerevisiae cell membranes were first immobilized on the surface of the silica gel to construct an affinity binding medium. A membrane-binding fraction was successfully screened by comparing the RP-HPLC fingerprint chromatograms of the hydrolyzate before and after adsorption with the adsorption medium. The amino acid sequence of the peptide was identified as LRLKKYKVPQL with the use of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer. The sequence corresponded to amino acid residues 99–109 of bovine αS1-casein. The results indicated that it is feasible to target screen antimicrobial peptides from protein hydrolyzate using S. cerevisiae cell membranes. The influences of thermal treatment, pH, ions, and enzymes on the activity of the purified peptide were also determined. The activity of the peptide was relatively thermally stable and was pH dependent. It retained more than 90% of its activity in the presence of 15% Na+, K+ and pepsin. Trypsin, proteinase K, divalent cation Mg2+ and Ca2+ reduced the activity to different extents. The peptide also showed antibacterial effectiveness in fresh pear juice.

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Cytomodulatory,4856224.979,37771645.66,1763010.831,23836727.17,21313935.32,14376563.03

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant,50726082.81,4510699.625,27161280,10334050.67,35320955.08,17064942.4

Milk and milk products prevent the bone loss in pre- and postmenopausal women. Apart from calcium, there are other biologically active compounds in milk such as bioactive peptides which may play a role in promoting bone health. Casein is the major protein in milk which has also been reported to have numerous biological active peptides within it. The hypothesis of the present study was to identify the key peptides behind osteoanabolic nature of the milk protein, which further can be used to prepare functional foods to alleviate bone diseases like osteoporosis.

These peptides were all generated from bovine αs1-casein and identified as IKHQGLPQE, VLNENLLR, and SDIPNPIGSENSEK. These peptides may have bioprotective applicability and potential use in milk-based formula, which has been linked to E. sakazakii infection in neonates.; 2) Caseicins A and B are low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptides which are released by proteolytic digestion of sodium caseinate. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) is a nine-amino-acid cationic peptide, and caseicin B (VLNENLLR) is a neutral eight-amino-acid peptide; both have previously been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against a number of pathogens, including Cronobacter sakazakii. Previously, four variants of each caseicin which differed subtly from their natural counterparts were generated by peptide synthesis. Antimicrobial activity assays revealed that the importance of a number of the residues within the peptides was dependent on the strain being targeted. In this study, this engineering-based approach was expanded through the creation of a larger collection of 26 peptides which are altered in a variety of ways. The investigation highlights the generally greater tolerance of caseicin B to change, the fact that changes have a more detrimental impact on anti-Gram-negative activity, and the surprising number of variants which exhibit enhanced activity against Staphylococcus aureus.; 3) Aims: The aim of this study was to identify Bacillus isolates capable of degrading sodium caseinate and subsequently to generate bioactive peptides with antimicrobial activity.

Methods and results: Sodium caseinate (2.5% w/v) was inoculated separately with 16 Bacillus isolates and allowed to ferment overnight. Protein breakdown in the fermentates was analysed using gel permeation-HPLC (GP-HPLC) and screened for peptides (<3-kDa) with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Caseicin A (IKHQGLPQE) and caseicin B (VLNENLLR), two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides, were identified in the fermentates of both Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis isolates. The caseicin peptides were subsequently purified by RP-HPLC and antimicrobial assays indicated that the peptides maintained the previously identified inhibitory activity against the infant formula pathogen Cronobacter sakazakii.

Conclusions: We report a new method using Bacillus sp. to generate two previously characterized antimicrobial peptides from casein.

Significance and impact of the study: This study highlights the potential to exploit Bacillus sp. or the enzymes they produce for the generation of bioactive antimicrobial peptides from bovine casein.",1) 10.1128/AEM.07312-11; 2) 10.1128/AEM.72.3.2260-2264.2006; 3) 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03271.x,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,32953346.66,432904.3229,,,19016014.23,

The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.",10.1128/AEM.01394-13,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,,,,,,

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

Five new DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides, four relatively large oligopeptides (MHQPPQPL, SPTVMFPPQSVL, VMFPPQSVL, and INNQFLPYPY), and AWPQYL were identified, and INNQFLPYPY showed a notable IC50 value of 40.08 μM as an uncompetitive inhibitor. Interactive effects on DPP-IV inhibition were also observed among separated fractions and pure synthetic peptide mixtures with concentration-dependent activity.

Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 2) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727.

These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals.

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.",10.3390/antiox9020117,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,,,,,,

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 3) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 4) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0; 3) 10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Immunomodulatory; Antithrombotic,1430439.221,73550.75781,,285357.7031,1159061.528,285357.7031

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved.

Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain.

The molecular masses of βC1, βC3, βC5, βC6, βC8, βC11, βC12, and βC14 were corresponded to the f(100–105), f(108–113), f(177–183), f(170–176), f(98–105), f(106–113), f(100–107), and f(170–183) regions of bovine β-casein, respectively. It was also found that the hydrophobicity of a peptide greatly contributes to its antibacterial activity, but positive charge does not. This study showed that the plasmin digest of β-casein can be regarded as a natural antibacterial agent in the food chain.",10.1016/j.lwt.2015.12.019,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial; ACE-inhibitory; Bradykinin-Potentiating; Increase mucin secretion,,,,,,

Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 2) Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).; 3) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 4) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.3390/foods9080991; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2004.02.011; 4) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(98)75878-3,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Increase mucin secretion; Opioid; Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory; Antianxiety; Anticancer; Immunomodulatory; Satiety; DPP-IV Inhibitory,532868.6025,2893380.57,3302269.513,2092788.604,1544516.589,2611137.565

Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably.

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Peptides derived from alpha s1- and beta-caseins by the Lactobacillus helveticus CP790 proteinase were investigated for their inhibitory activities against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity.

A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 4) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,,126360.567,109543.7402,690907.9688,126360.567,303331.8164

Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.",10.4014/jmb.2104.04013,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant; Antimicrobial,440490.1328,47894.01758,135010.194,271662.4531,178759.3893,189671.0976

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) The aim of this study was to investigate the multifunctional properties of specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 on the inhibition of enzymes involved in hypertension (ACE), type 2 diabetes (DPP-IV) and thrombosis (thrombin). Moreover, in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was performed in order to know the stability of peptides and its effect on the biological activities. Also, in silico analysis was employed for the prediction of sequences after digestion. Results showed that peptide inhibitory activities on ACE, DPP-IV and thrombin were enhanced after digestion. After in vitro digestion, peptide NAVPITPTLN showed the best efficiency to inhibit DPP-IV. Likewise, NAVPITPTLN and QEPVLGPVRGPFIIV showed high thrombin inhibitory activities, and HPHPHLSFMAIPP and SLPQNIPPL presented high ACE inhibitory activities. In vitro and in silico studies indicated that these peptides are precursors of multifunctional peptide sequences. Therefore, this study suggests that the specific synthetic peptides previously identified in milk fermented with Lactococcus lactis NRRL B-50571 and NRRL B-50572 offer potential beneficial health effects in the management of hypertension, thrombosis and diabetes.",1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112581; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005,sequence,IDENTITY,DPP-IV Inhibitory,89255825.16,13159263.63,10859421.46,14088498.07,56643013.08,12704608.09

Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight.

Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity; 2) The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity.

The αs1-casein tryptic hydrolysate containing this peptide decreases stress effects after oral administration in various species including man. Therefore, the stability of this peptide toward gastric and pancreatic proteases has been assessed by using pepsin, chymotrypsin/trypsin, Corolase PP, pepsin followed by chymotrypsin/trypsin or pepsin followed by Corolase PP. α-Casozepine was slowly degraded by chymotrypsin, much more sensitive to pepsin and Corolase PP but not completely destroyed after 4 h kinetics. The bonds in the region 91 to 95 of the α-casozepine were totally resistant to hydrolysis by all studied proteases. Surprisingly, a fragment, corresponding to the sequence 91−97 and found in all the hydrolysis media in significant amount, possessed an anxiolytic activity in three behavioral tests measuring this parameter. This peptide could participate in the in vivo activity of α-casozepine.; 2) α-Casozepine and f91–97, peptides from αs1-casein, display anxiolytic activity in rats and may have to cross the intestinal epithelium to exert this central effect. We evaluated their resistance to hydrolysis by the peptidases of Caco-2 cells and their ability to cross the cell monolayer. To mimic physiological conditions, two preparations of bile salts were used in noncytotoxic concentrations: porcine bile extract and an equimolar mixture of taurocholate, cholate, and deoxycholate. The presence and composition of bile salts appeared to modulate the peptidase activities of the Caco-2 cells involved (i) in the hydrolysis of α-casozepine, leading to much higher formation of fragments f91–99, f91–98, and f91–97, and (ii) in the hydrolysis of f91–97, leading to lower degradation of this peptide. Transport of α-casozepine across Caco-2 monolayer increased significantly, in the presence of bile extract, and of fragment f91–97, in the presence of bile salts.; 3) Hydrolyzed infant formulas serve as appropriate nutritional sources for infants afflicted with cow’s milk allergy, and milk proteins in hydrolyzed formulas are industrially hydrolyzed extensively or partially. To investigate whether industrial hydrolysis may modulate the digestive trajectory of milk proteins, thereby releasing different profiles of bioactive peptides compared with standard formulas, both standard and hydrolyzed formulas were subjected to in vitro digestion and formation of bioactive peptides were compared. One standard, one extensively hydrolyzed, and one partially hydrolyzed infant formula were digested in vitro with pepsin and pancreatin, taking into account the higher gastric pH of infants, and the digesta were subjected to peptidomic analysis. The standard formula released a larger variety of bioactive peptides than from the hydrolyzed formulas, indicating that industrial hydrolysis of milk proteins may generally attenuate their indigenous bioactivities such as antibacterial, immuno-regulatory, and anti-oxidative activities. Conversely, industrial hydrolysis may facilitate the formation of bioactive peptides from hydrophobic proteins/regions such as β-LG and the “strategic zone” of β-CN, which encrypt bioactive peptides including a dipeptidyl dipeptidase-4-inhibitory, hypocholesterolemic, and opioid peptides. Infants fed hydrolyzed infant formulas may be influenced by milk protein-derived bioactive peptides in a manner different from those fed standard formula.",1) 10.1021/jf202890e; 2) 10.1021/jf104089c; 3) 10.1016/j.peptides.2015.09.005,sequence,IDENTITY,Antianxiety,698683.3713,122207.028,,42980.52344,451622.0813,42980.52344

Most of these products showed moderate inhibitory activity, but two exceptions that corresponded to an extensively hydrolysed whey formula and an extensively hydrolysed casein formula were detected. Two products (a non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula and an extensively hydrolysed whey formula) were subjected to a two-stage in vitro enzymatic procedure, which simulates physiological digestion, in order to study the impact of digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity. The ACE-inhibitory activity of the non-hydrolysed formula increased during simulated gastrointestinal digestion, while no significant change was observed in the activity of the hydrolysed whey formula prior to and after, digestion. The peptides generated from these two products during simulated physiological digestion were sequenced by tandem spectrometry. At the end of the digestion, most peptides found in the non-hydrolysed milk protein-based formula were formed during incubation with the pancreatic extract, but, in the hydrolysed whey formula, many peptides present in the undigested product survived simulated digestion. The potential ACE-inhibitory activity of these peptides is discussed with regard to their amino-acid sequences.; 2) Whey protein was digested with one of seven kinds of proteases at 37 degrees C (trypsin, proteinase K, actinase E, thermolysin, or papain) or at 25 degrees C (pepsin or chymotrypsin) for 24 h. The digested samples were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme and for changes in the systolic blood pressure caused in spontaneously hypertensive rats after gastric intubation. The strongest depressive effect on the systolic blood pressure (-55 mm Hg) was observed at 6 h after gastric intubation of the whey protein that was digested by proteinase K. Finally, six peptides were chromatographically isolated from the proteinase K digest by a combination of hydrophobic reversed-phase HPLC and gel filtration. The amino acid sequences and their origins were clarified as follows: Val-Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly [beta-casein (CN); f 59-64], Gly-Lys-Pro (beta 2-microglobulin; f 18-20), Ile-Pro-Ala (beta-lactoglobulin; f 78-80), Phe-Pro (serum albumin; f 221-222; beta-CN, f 62-63, f 157-158, and f 205-206), Val-Tyr-Pro (beta-CN; f 59-61), and Thr-Pro-Val-Val-Val-Pro-Pro-Phe-Leu-Gln-Pro (beta-CN; f 80-90). Chemical synthesis of these six peptides confirmed that all peptides, except an undecapeptide, have antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ala, originating from beta-lactoglobulin, showed the strongest antihypertensive activity (-31 mm Hg).; 3) Currently, the associations between oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and metabolic disturbances and non-communicable diseases are very well known. Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals.

As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF.

Production did not depend on the presence of lactose or galactose in the culture medium or on a coculture of the producer strain with macedocin-sensitive or macedocin-resistant strains.

The present study sheds light on the importance of specific amino acids of the milk-derived αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide to its antibacterial activity against the food-borne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Cronobacter sakazakii. Trimming of the peptide revealed that residues at the C-terminal end of the peptide are important for activity. Removal of the last 5 amino acids at the C-terminal end and replacement of the Arg at position 23 of the peptide sequence by an Ala residue significantly decreased activity. These findings suggest that Arg23 is very important for optimal activity of the peptide. Substitution of the also positively charged Lys residues at positions 15 and 17 of the αs2-casein f(183–207) peptide also caused a significant reduction of the effectiveness against C. sakazakii, which points toward the importance of the positive charge of the peptide for its biological activity. Indeed, simultaneous replacement of various positively charged amino acids was linked to a loss of bactericidal activity. On the other hand, replacement of Pro residues at positions 14 and 20 resulted in a significantly increased antibacterial potency, and hydrophobic end tagging of αs2-casein f(193–203) and αs2-casein f(197–207) peptides with multiple Trp or Phe residues significantly increased their potency against L. monocytogenes. Finally, the effect of pH (4.5 to 7.4), temperature (4°C to 37°C), and addition of sodium and calcium salts (1% to 3%) on the activity of the 15-amino-acid αs2-casein f(193–207) peptide was also determined, and its biological activity was shown to be completely abolished in high-saline environments.",10.1128/AEM.01394-13,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,,607020.8594,139044.6302,226621.7266,607020.8594,189088.6853

MKP showed angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.43 μM). An in vivo kinetics study using radiolabeled Met-[1-14C]Lys-Pro (14C-MKP) showed that orally administered 14C-MKP to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) was absorbed and moved into the plasma. In vitro vasoconstriction of thoracic aorta preparations, which was induced by adding angiotensin I, was reduced by prior exposure of MKP. A single oral dose of MKP lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) of SHRs, and repeated oral administration of MKP for 28 days significantly lowered SBP of SHRs. The results obtained in the present study suggest that orally administrated MKP can be absorbed into the plasma and its ACE-inhibitory activity may contribute to induce the antihypertensive effect in vivo.; 2) The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.; 3) Physiological digestion plays a key role in the formation and degradation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a simulated gastrointestinal digestion on the stability of eight peptides previously identified in fermented milk with antihypertensive activity. Two of these identified peptides with sequences LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, possess ACE-inhibitory activity in vitro and antihypertensive activity in vivo. The results showed that LHLPLP was resistant to digestive enzymes. In contrast, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP was totally hydrolyzed and its activity decreased after incubation with pepsin and a pancreatic extract. The peptide LHLPLP was incubated with ACE and was found to be a true inhibitor of the enzyme and to exhibit a competitive inhibitor pattern. A structure-activity relationship study of this peptide was carried out by synthesizing several modified peptides related to the sequence LHLPLP. The substitution of amino acid Leu in the penultimate position by Gly improved the ACE-inhibitory activity twofold and the substitution of Pro at C-terminal position by Arg increased the activity twofold, with an IC50 of LHLPLR as low as 1.8 microM.; 4) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 5) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.",10.3390/antiox9020117,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant; ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory,,,,,,

Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,920297.828,,,14327.73438,920297.828,14327.73438

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

Forty-three peptide peaks were isolated and tested. Seven casokinins (i.e. CN-derived ACE inhibitory peptides) were identified and their IC50 values were determined. Four peptides exhibited an IC50 value lower than 20 μM. Peptides αS2-CN (f174–181) and αS2-CN (f174–179) had IC50 values of 4 μM. Surprisingly, deletion of the C-terminal dipeptide of two of these casokinins did not significantly alter their inhibitory activity; 2) The aim of this work was to investigate the presence of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity in ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein hydrolysates with antibacterial activity. Several peptides which had been previously identified in these hydrolysates were selected in order to fulfil certain structural requirements and they were chemically synthesised to evaluate their antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activity. Hydrolysates of ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein and bovine $\kappa $-casein with pepsin strongly inhibited ACE activity, with IC50 values of 41.8 and 9.97 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively. The $\kappa $-casein hydrolysate also exhibited a significant oxygen radical absorbance capacity, seven times higher than that of Trolox. From the chemically synthesised peptides, two of them, LKKISQ and PYVRYL, both from ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein, exerted potent ACE-inhibitory activity in the range of the most potent food-derived antihypertensive peptides described to date (IC50 values of 2.6 and 2.4 $\mu $mol$\cdot$L-1, respectively). The latter sequence, corresponding to the C-terminal hexapeptide of the ovine $\alpha _{\rm s2}$-casein molecule, also had antioxidant activity. The activity found is discussed in relation to the peptide sequences.",1) 10.1051/lait:2007019; 2) 10.1016/s0014-5793(02)03576-7,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant,468303.5479,1505295.063,186933.3086,122677.2539,986799.3052,150215.5631

Approximately 3094 peptides were identified by nESI-LC–MS/MS in the hydrolyzed yak milk residue. Peptide KALNEINQF (T10) is the strongest antioxidant peptide. The damage model of H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was used to evaluate the antioxidant effect. After treatment with 25, 50, or 100 μg/mL T10 peptide, T10 obviously decreased H2O2-induced damage and increased the cell survival. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were significantly increased 1.03, 1.1, and 1.33 times, and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were significantly increased 1.11, 1.30, and 1.43 times, respectively. Malondialdehyde (MDA) also reduced 1.41, 1.54, and 1.72 times, respectively. T10 inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis in HUVECs, and protein expressions of the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2 and bax were increased and decreased by 1.95 and 1.44 times, respectively, suggesting T10 decreases apoptosis of the mitochondria-dependent pathway. Comparing with the H2O2-induced damage group, the RNA expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.00, 2.11, and 1.94 times; the protein expressions of p-Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were significantly increased by 2.67, 1.73, and 1.04 times; and Keap1 was downregulated by 3.9 and 1.32 times, respectively. T10 also regulated the Nrf2 pathway and expressions of related genes (Keap1, HO-1, and NQO1), and blocking the Nrf2 pathway in the model decreased the protective effect of T10. Taken together, T10 peptide isolated from yak milk residue has a protective effect against H2O2-induced damage in HUVECs and the molecular mechanisms are involved in the regulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and cell apoptosis.",10.1155/2021/9426314,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant; ACE-inhibitory; Antimicrobial,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,20407363.83,16437193,5619299.25,8719806.875,18422278.42,7686304.333

In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the potential ability of N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E to bind Keap1, showing their destabilizing effect on Keap1/Nrf2 interaction.",10.3390/antiox9020117,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant; ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory,,,,,,

Besides, the octapeptide YPVEPFTE showed an in vitro competitive inhibitor effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme and thimet oligopeptidase and presented an opiate-like activity, increasing two times the latence time in the hot-plate assay.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,44730.12175,2648721.25,992608.8023,1746115.641,1346725.686,1423184.139

The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2·5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37°C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, β-lactoglobulin f(92–100) and β-casein f(191–205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14–42) or lactoferrampin C f(268–284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.; 2) Proteolytic digestion of bovine β-lactoglobulin by trypsin yielded four peptide fragments with bactericidal activity. The peptides were isolated and their sequences were found as follows: VAGTWY (residues 15–20), AASDISLLDAQSAPLR (residues 25–40), IPAVFK (residues 78–83) and VLVLDTDYK (residues 92–100). The four peptides were synthesized and found to exert bactericidal effects against the Gram-positive bacteria only. In order to understand the structural requirements for antibacterial activity, the amino acid sequence of the peptide VLVLDTDYK was modified. The replacement of the Asp (98) residue by Arg and the addition of a Lys residue at the C-terminus yielded the peptide VLVLDTRYKK which enlarged the bactericidal activity spectrum to the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Bordetella bronchiseptica and significantly reduced the antibacterial capacity of the peptide toward Bacillus subtilis. By data base searches with the sequence VLVLDTRYKK a high homology was found with the peptide VLVATLRYKK (residues 55–64) of human blue-sensitive opsin, the protein of the blue pigment responsible for color vision. A peptide with this sequence was synthesized and assayed for bactericidal activity. VLVATLRYKK was strongly active against all the bacterial strains tested. Our results suggest a possible antimicrobial function of β-lactoglobulin after its partial digestion by endopeptidases of the pancreas and show moreover that small targeted modifications in the sequence of β-lactoglobulin could be useful to increase its antimicrobial function.",1) 10.1017/S0007114511001085; 2) 10.1016/s0304-4165(01)00116-7,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial; DPP-IV Inhibitory,488067.0313,,289170.7032,49489.86719,488067.0313,209277.0912

Macedocin was produced when the strain was grown in milk but not in MRS or M17 broth. No autoinduction mechanism was observed. Production did not depend on the presence of lactose or galactose in the culture medium or on a coculture of the producer strain with macedocin-sensitive or macedocin-resistant strains. Induction seemed to depend on the presence of one or more heat-stable protein components produced when S. macedonicus ACA-DC 198 was grown in milk. The partial purification of the induction factor was performed by a combination of chromatography methods, and its activity was confirmed by a reverse transcription-PCR approach (RT-PCR). Mass spectrometric (MS) and tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analyses of an induction-active fraction showed the presence of several peptides of low molecular mass corresponding to fragments of αS1- and β-casein as well as β-lactoglobulin.

Hydrolysates were withdrawn at different hydrolysis phases and were determined to their degree of hydrolysis (DH) and ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme) inhibitory (ACEI) activities. Using a 3 kDa ultra-filtration membrane, hydrolysates were fractioned into two ranges of molecular weight and permeated fractions were further investigated. A Lineweaver-Burk plot was used to explore the ACEI kinetics of the hydrolysates. Additionally, the peptides in the hydrolysates were identified using LC-MS/MS. We established four quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting potential ACEI peptides. Using in silico analysis, four novel ACEI peptides were identified and a molecular docking study further explored the potential ACEI activities. Based on the docking results, three new peptides (PFPGPIPN, KYIPIQ and LPLPLL) were chemically synthesized and their IC50 values were determined. In conclusion, our study suggests that Qula casein may be a valuable source of ACEI peptides.; 2) Yak (Bos grunniens) milk casein derived from Qula, a kind of acid curd cheese from northwestern China, was hydrolysed with alcalase. The hydrolysates collected at different hydrolysis times (0 min, 60 min, 120 min, 180 min, 240 min, 300 min, 360 min) were assayed for the inhibitory activity of angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE), and the one obtained at 240 min hydrolysis showed the highest ACE inhibitory activity. The active hydrolysate was further consecutively separated by ultrafiltration with 10 kDa and then with 6 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes into different parts, and the 6 kDa permeate showed the highest ACE-inhibiting activity. This active fraction was further purified to yield two novel ACE-inhibiting peptides, whose amino acid sequences were Pro–Pro–Glu–Ile–Asn (PPEIN)(κ-CN; f156–160) and Pro–Leu–Pro–Leu–Leu (PLPLL) (β-CN; f136–140), respectively.

Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt.

In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 2) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,440053.7109,78440.46614,,26366.15821,285076.606,26366.15821

In this work, we studied two different preparations of peptide Asp-Lys-Ile-His-Pro (DKIHP), which were obtained by two different synthetic procedures (Boc and Fmoc). The peptide synthesized by the Boc method yielded a unique conformer, containing trans-Pro, and significant ACE-inhibitory activity (IC50 = 113.18 μM). The chromatographic and NMR data of this active conformer are reported. The peptide synthesized by Fmoc chemistry yielded three conformers, two of them containing trans-Pro and a third one containing cis-Pro, and showed a lower activity (IC50 = 577.92 μM). This was attributed to the presence of conformers with less (or none) activity. We have pointed out the importance of performing structural studies on these type of peptides before testing their ACE-inhibitory activity.; 2) A total of 75 peptides included in the fraction with molecular mass below 3000 from an 8-month-old Manchego cheese could be identified using HPLC coupled on line to an ion trap mass spectrometer. Some previously described peptides with antihypertensive and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were detected. The formation of five active sequences was followed during cheese ripening in four different batches of Manchego cheese. Two experimental batches of Manchego cheese elaborated with selected bacterial strains with the aim of improve the organoleptic characteristics demonstrated also a good performance in the formation of peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity during cheese ripening.; 3) Two fermented milks containing angiotensin-I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides were produced by using selectedLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus SS1 and L. lactis subsp. cremoris FT4. The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably. A strengthened inhibitory effect of the peptide mixtures with respect to the activity of individual peptides was presumed. Once generated, the inhibitory peptides were resistant to further proteolysis either during dairy processing or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.",1) 10.1016/j.chroma.2004.05.022; 2) 10.1128/AEM.66.9.3898-3904.2000; 3) 10.1021/jf049532f,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,4245824640,2831548155,3810009073,1945603126,3639706147,2744634246

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.; 2) Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.",1) 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.05.004; 2) 10.1017/S0022029914000533,sequence,IDENTITY,Increase mucin secretion; Opioid; Wound healing,61401.03516,,,456302.9688,61401.03516,456302.9688

This peptide, composed of 30 amino acid residues, maintains intestinal homoeostasis through production of the secreted mucin MUC2 and of the transmembrane-associated mucin MUC4. Our study aimed to search for the minimal sequence responsible for the biological activity of β-CN(94-123) by using several strategies based on (i) known bioactive peptides encrypted in β-CN(94-123), (ii) in silico prediction of peptides reactivity and (iii) digestion of β-CN(94-123) by enzymes of intestinal brush border membranes. The revealed sequences were tested in vitro on human intestinal mucus-producing HT29-MTX cells. We demonstrated that β-CN(108-113) (an ACE-inhibitory peptide) and β-CN(114-119) (an opioid peptide named neocasomorphin-6) up-regulated MUC4 expression whereas levels of the secreted mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC remained unchanged. The digestion of β-CN(94-123) by intestinal enzymes showed that the peptides β-CN(94-108) and β-CN(117-123) were present throughout 1·5 to 3 h of digestion, respectively. These two peptides raised MUC5AC expression while β-CN(117-123) also induced a decrease in the level of MUC2 mRNA and protein. In addition, this inhibitory effect was reproduced in airway epithelial cells. In conclusion, β-CN(94-123) is a multifunctional molecule but only the sequence of 30 amino acids has a stimulating effect on the production of MUC2, a crucial factor of intestinal protection.; 2) Several studies demonstrated that fermented milks may provide a large number of bioactive peptides into the gastrointestinal tract. We previously showed that beta-casomorphin-7, an opioid-like peptide produced from bovine β-casein, strongly stimulates intestinal mucin production in ex vivo and in vitro models, suggesting the potential benefit of milk bioactive peptides on intestinal protection. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the total peptide pool (TPP) from a fermented milk (yoghurt) may act on human intestinal mucus-producing cells (HT29-MTX) to induce mucin expression. Our aim was then to identify the peptide(s) carrying the biological activity and to study its impact in vivo on factors involved in gut protection after oral administration to rat pups (once a day, 9 consecutive days). TPP stimulated MUC2 and MUC4 gene expression as well as mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Among the four peptide fractions that were separated by preparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, only the C2 fraction was able to mimic the in vitro effect of TPP. Interestingly, the sequence [94-123] of β-casein, present only in C2 fraction, also regulated mucin production in HT29-MTX cells. Oral administration of this peptide to rat pups enhanced the number of goblet cells and Paneth cells along the small intestine. These effects were associated with a higher expression of intestinal mucins (Muc2 and Muc4) and of antibacterial factors (lysozyme, rdefa5). We conclude that the peptide β-CN(94-123) present in yoghurts may maintain or restore intestinal homeostasis and could play an important role in protection against damaging agents of the intestinal lumen.",1) 10.1016/j.jnutbio.2012.05.004; 2) 10.1017/S0022029914000533,sequence,IDENTITY,Increase mucin secretion; Opioid; Wound healing,,,,,,

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM). Peptides present within the gastrointestinal tract of human may have promise for the development of natural DPP-IV inhibitors for the management of serum glucose.; 2) Nine novel dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides (FLQY, FQLGASPY, ILDKEGIDY, ILELA, LLQLEAIR, LPVP, LQALHQGQIV, MPVQA and SPVVPF) were identified in camel milk proteins hydrolysed with trypsin. This was achieved using a sequential approach combining liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), qualitative/quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) and confirmatory studies with synthetic peptides. The most potent camel milk protein-derived DPP-IV inhibitory peptides, LPVP and MPVQA, had DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 87.0 ± 3.2 and 93.3 ± 8.0 µM, respectively. DPP-IV inhibitory peptide sequences identified within camel and bovine milk protein hydrolysates generated under the same hydrolysis conditions differ. This was linked to differences in enzyme selectivity for peptide bond cleavage of camel and bovine milk proteins as well as dissimilarities in their amino acid sequences. Camel milk proteins contain novel DPP-IV inhibitory peptides which may play a role in the regulation of glycaemia in humans.",1) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.10.033; 2) 10.1016/j.peptides.2016.03.005,sequence,IDENTITY,DPP-IV Inhibitory; Opioid; Antimicrobial; Antioxidant; Increase mucin secretion,4753719.824,617800.3438,1058499.109,444521.5664,2981182.904,649180.7474

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,,,,,,

In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.; 2) Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively.

Scope

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,31486261.44,13563225.06,579250.625,5356555.205,23804960.14,3445633.373

Combination of two microbial proteases, Protin SD-NY10 and Protease A “Amano” 2SD, was employed to hydrolyze casein to obtain potential antioxidant peptides that were identified by LCMS/ MS, chemically synthesized and characterized in a oxidatively damaged HepG2 cell model. Four peptides, YQLD, FSDIPNPIGSEN, FSDIPNPIGSE, YFYP were found to possess high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability. Evaluation with HepG2 cells showed that the 4 peptides at low concentrations (< 1.0 mg/ml) protected the cells against oxidative damage. The 4 peptides exhibited different levels of antioxidant activity by stimulating mRNA and protein expression of the antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), as well as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), but decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Furthermore, these peptides decreased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), but increased glutathione (GSH) production in HepG2 cells. Therefore, the 4 casein-derived peptides obtained by using microbial proteases exhibited different antioxidant activity by activating the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway, and they could serve as potential antioxidant agents in functional foods or pharmaceutic preparation.",10.4014/jmb.2104.04013,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant; Antimicrobial,,,,,,

Since these risk factors show a preventable character, the searching of food peptides acting against them has become a promising strategy for the design and development of new multifunctional foods or nutraceuticals. In the present study, an integrated approach combining an in silico study and in vitro assays was used to confirm the multifunctionality of milk and meat protein-derived peptides that were similar to or shared amino acids with previously described opioid peptides. By the in silico analysis, 15 of the 27 assayed peptides were found to exert two or more activities, with Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and opioid being the most commonly found. The in vitro study confirmed ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities in 15 and 26 of the 27 synthetic peptides, respectively. Four fragments, RYLGYLE, YLGYLE, YFYPEL, and YPWT, also demonstrated the ability to protect Caco-2 and macrophages RAW264.7 cells from the oxidative damage caused by chemicals. The multifunctionality of these peptides makes them promising agents against oxidative stress-associated diseases.; 2) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 3) In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide β-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.; 4) Seven kinds of ripened cheeses (8-mo-aged and 24-mo-aged Gouda, Emmental, Blue, Camembert, Edam, and Havarti) were homogenized with distilled water, and water-soluble peptides were prepared by C-18 hydrophobic chromatography. The inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme and decrease in the systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats were measured before and after oral administration of each peptide sample. The strongest depressive effect in the systolic blood pressure (-24.7 mm Hg) and intensive inhibitory activity to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (75.7%) were detected in the peptides from 8-mo-aged Gouda cheese. Four peptides were isolated by HPLC with reverse-phase and gel filtration modes. Their chemical structures and origins, clarified by combination analyses of protein sequencing, amino acid composition, and mass spectrometry, were as follows: peptide A, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln [alpha(s1)-casein (CN), B-8P; f 1-9]; peptide B, Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-Gln-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gln (alpha(s1)-CN, B-8P; f 1-13); peptide F, Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 60-68); and peptide G, Met-Pro-Phe-Pro-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Val-Gln-Pro-Phe (beta-CN, A2-5P; f 109-119). Peptides A and F, which were chemically synthesized, showed potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory activity with little antihypertensive effects.; 5) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures. The radical scavenging activity was determined with the ABTS assay, and IC50 values between 20 and 25 μg ml−1 were obtained for the generated peptide mixtures. In addition, the identified VYPFPGPIPN peptide exhibited ACE inhibition and antioxidant activity with IC50 values of 325 and 6.2 μM, respectively. The peptide YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV exhibited radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value of 5.2 μM.",1) 10.3390/foods9080991; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(00)75013-2; 3) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(05)73032-0; 4) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2009.07.003; 5) 10.1007/s00217-012-1894-5,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Antianxiety; Prolyl endopeptidase-inhibitory; DPP-IV Inhibitory,1565681.75,258941,8924436,2213292.654,585626.1875,5089496.945

In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.; 2) Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined. NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), which was the only synthetic peptide also present in the sodium caseinate hydrolysates, and NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48) showed the highest inhibition of ACE activity, with IC50 values of 15 and 55 μM, respectively. Furthermore, the stability of all synthetic peptides was assessed using an in vitro model simulating gastric digestion. The β-casein-derived peptides remained intact following the successive hydrolysis by pepsin and pancreatin, whereas αS1-casein-derived peptides were degraded by pepsin.",1) 10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621; 2) 10.1021/jf049510t,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antimicrobial,540836.3477,978283.8959,916477.5086,1292259.677,728313.8683,1104368.593

The most active hydrolysate against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Listeria innocua CECT 910T corresponded to a pepsin digest of bovine kappa-casein. The protein digest was first separated by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the most active fractions were again subjected to a second chromatographic step. Finally, identification of the active peptides was carried out by online and offline HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. By means of this technique, 21 peptides were identified in the active HPLC fractions. Although most were derived from bovine kappa-casein, some of the identified fragments corresponded to beta-casein and alpha(s)-casein fragments, a result of the presence of small amounts of these proteins in the preparation of kappa-casein. Some of the peptides identified were chemically synthesized and showed antibacterial effects against several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Milk was fermented with a total of 25 lactic acid bacteria to assay in vitro inhibitory activity towards angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 4) Bacillus lentus alkaline peptidase (BLAP) was used for casein (CN) hydrolysis in an enzyme membrane reactor (EMR) because it was found that BLAP was competitively inhibited by its products. The employed membranes had different molecular weight cut-offs (MWCO 1, 5 and 10 kDa). It was shown that the productivity of the EMR could be significantly improved (28 %) in comparison with batch hydrolysis under the same conditions after 20 h. All resulting EMR peptide mixtures showed a homogenous peptide pattern in HPLC–UV analysis. The obtained peptide mixtures exhibited Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antioxidative activity. The ACE inhibition of the peptide mixtures was dependent on the MWCO of the membranes. The resulting apparent IC50 values were 115, 131 and 420 μg ml−1 for the 1, 5 and 10 kDa MWCO membranes, respectively. In kinetic studies, a mixed-type inhibition was observed for the three peptide mixtures.

The tested strains belonged to Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lacobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactococcus. raffinolactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides ssp. cremoris. The ACE inhibitory potencies of theses strains varied and seven of them showing the highest ACE inhibitory activity were selected for further studies. The development of ACE inhibitory activity during fermentation correlated with degree of hydrolysis. Modification of fermentation conditions or pH control did not affect the ACE inhibitory activity. ACE inhibitory compounds from Lb. jensenii fermented milk were isolated by reversed phase HPLC and identified by MS-analysis and amino acid sequencing. The active compounds were peptides from β-casein. The milk fermented with Lb. jensenii caused a transient reduction of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.; 2) Water-soluble peptides from Mozzarella, Italico, Crescenza, and Gorgonzola cheeses were fractionated by reverse-phase fast protein liquid chromatography. Peptide fractions with inhibitory activity to amino- and endo-peptidases from Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus B397, Streptococcus thermophilus 305, and Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris Wg2 were found. Enzymes from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 were less sensitive. Endopeptidase from Lactobacillus casei ssp. casei 2752 also had a different response to the effect of some inhibitors. It probably showed limited differences in catalysis and substrate positioning. Most of these inhibitory peptides were also effective in reducing the activity of the Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 948 endopeptidase and the angiotensin I-converting enzyme. Inhibitory peptide fractions from Mozzarella, Italico, and Crescenza cheeses had a certain degree of hydrophobicity while the peptide fraction from Gorgonzola cheese eluted in the initial part of the acetonitrile gradient. One of the inhibitory peptides contained in the water-soluble extract of Crescenza cheese was further purified and sequenced.

Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.; 3) Purification of small bioactive peptides from complex biological samples is a difficult task due to the interference of concentrated large biomolecules. In this study, a magnetic immobilized metal affinity chromatography matrix modified by poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (IMACM@mPEG) was prepared and applied for the rapid purification of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from casein hydrolysate. The proposed IMACM@mPEG considerably reduced the non-specific adsorption of large proteins and exhibited improved purification efficiency towards ACE inhibitory peptides. A novel peptide with moderate ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 274 ± 5 μM) was identified as LLYQEPVLGPVR. Lineweaver-Burk plot confirmed the non-competitive inhibition pattern of LLYQEPVLGPVR. The purified peptide was digested after simulated gastrointestinal digestion and produced shorter peptides which contributed to enhanced ACE inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the IMACM@mPEG is an effective method for the prepurification of ACE inhibitory peptide and the purified peptide LLYQEPVLGPVR may have potential as nutraceutical ingredient in functional foods for hypertension treatments.; 4) The peptide profile of a ripened cheese (Basque Idiazabal D.O.) was analysed using an orthogonal HPLC separation, strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The spectra obtained were searched against several in house databases for peptide fragment fingerprint identification. 231 Peptides from milk proteins and from microbial enzymes fragments were identified. The potential angiotensin-converting enzyme- (ACE-) inhibitory activity of the identified peptides was predicted with a quantitative structure–activity relationship model developed previously for peptides with a length larger than 5 residues. Ten peptides were synthesised and tested for their in vitro ACE-inhibitory activity, among them six novel peptides presented a high activity in vitro with IC50 values of between 4 and 32 μm. The proposed methodology can be used for screening for bioactive peptides in complex matrices, such as ripened cheese.",1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2012.12.006; 3) 10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.122042; 4) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory; Antioxidant; Antithrombotic; Cytomodulatory,,,,,,

The αs1-casein tryptic hydrolysate containing this peptide decreases stress effects after oral administration in various species including man. Therefore, the stability of this peptide toward gastric and pancreatic proteases has been assessed by using pepsin, chymotrypsin/trypsin, Corolase PP, pepsin followed by chymotrypsin/trypsin or pepsin followed by Corolase PP. α-Casozepine was slowly degraded by chymotrypsin, much more sensitive to pepsin and Corolase PP but not completely destroyed after 4 h kinetics. The bonds in the region 91 to 95 of the α-casozepine were totally resistant to hydrolysis by all studied proteases. Surprisingly, a fragment, corresponding to the sequence 91−97 and found in all the hydrolysis media in significant amount, possessed an anxiolytic activity in three behavioral tests measuring this parameter. This peptide could participate in the in vivo activity of α-casozepine.; 2) α-Casozepine and f91–97, peptides from αs1-casein, display anxiolytic activity in rats and may have to cross the intestinal epithelium to exert this central effect. We evaluated their resistance to hydrolysis by the peptidases of Caco-2 cells and their ability to cross the cell monolayer. To mimic physiological conditions, two preparations of bile salts were used in noncytotoxic concentrations: porcine bile extract and an equimolar mixture of taurocholate, cholate, and deoxycholate. The presence and composition of bile salts appeared to modulate the peptidase activities of the Caco-2 cells involved (i) in the hydrolysis of α-casozepine, leading to much higher formation of fragments f91–99, f91–98, and f91–97, and (ii) in the hydrolysis of f91–97, leading to lower degradation of this peptide. Transport of α-casozepine across Caco-2 monolayer increased significantly, in the presence of bile extract, and of fragment f91–97, in the presence of bile salts.",1) 10.1021/jf104089c; 2) 10.1021/jf202890e,sequence,IDENTITY,Antianxiety; Antioxidant; Increase mucin secretion; ACE-inhibitory; Anticancer,,,,,,

The pH 4.6-soluble nitrogen fraction of the two fermented milks was fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest ACE-inhibitory indexes were further purified, and the related peptides were sequenced by tandem fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most inhibitory fractions of the milk fermented by L. delbrueckii subsp.bulgaricus SS1 contained the sequences of β-casein (β-CN) fragment 6-14 (f6-14), f7-14, f73-82, f74-82, and f75-82. Those from the milk fermented by L. lactis subsp.cremoris FT4 contained the sequences of β-CN f7-14, f47-52, and f169-175 and κ-CN f155-160 and f152-160. Most of these sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. In particular, the β-CN f47-52 sequence had high homology with that of angiotensin-II. Some of these peptides were chemically synthesized. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of the crude purified fractions containing the peptide mixture were very low (8.0 to 11.2 mg/liter). When the synthesized peptides were used individually, the ACE-inhibitory activity was confirmed but the IC50s increased considerably.

Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.",10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,36300.77734,,125023.5703,128020.8985,36300.77734,127421.4328

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide.

Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory,,,,,,

As preliminary step, fast protein LC (FPLC) was used to isolate the different casein fractions from raw ovine milk. Enzymatic hydrolysis of these fractions was performed by using proteolytic enzymes of gastrointestinal origin. The most active hydrolysate, corresponding to κ-casein hydrolyzed with pepsin, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, was fractionated by RP-HPLC and the peptides contained in the active fractions were sequenced by CE coupled to IT-MS (CE-MS). The use of CE-MS allowed the identification of short peptides with ACEI activity included in the scarcely retained fraction obtained by semipreparative RP-HPLC. Among the identified peptides, those with hydrophobic or positively charged residues at the C-terminal tripeptide were chemically synthesized to determine their ACEI activity. This procedure allowed us to identify four novel potent ACEI peptides from κ-casein with sequences IAK, YQQRPVA, WQVLPNAVPAK, and HPHPHLSF. These active sequences could be obtained by enzymatic hydrolysis either of the individual κ-casein fraction or the total casein fraction from ovine milk.; 2) Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified from milk fermented using Lactobacillus delbrueckii QS306. The peptide with the highest angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity (C5) was purified using ultrafiltration with 10 and 3 kDa molecular mass cut-off membranes, Sephadex G-15 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) gel filtration chromatography, reversed-phase HPLC, and Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We obtained peptide LPYPY by microbial fermentation, which was derived from κ-casein f (AA 77–81). We synthesized LPYPY using an Fmoc solid-phase synthesis method and explored the secondary structure of the pentapeptide. The half maximal inhibitory concentration for the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of LPYPY was 12.87 μg/mL.

To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

Yoghurt samples were stripped from sugars and lactic acid and subsequently fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with cut off sizes of 30 kDa, 10 kDa and 3 kDa. The fractions were tested for antioxidant activity by investigating the inhibition of oxidation in liposome model system, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, iron-chelating activity, and reducing power. The lower molecular weight fractions were found to be more effective antioxidants than higher molecular weight fractions. The lower molecular fractions were further tested as antioxidants in fish-oil-enriched milk. On the basis of peroxide value, volatiles, tocopherol and sensory characteristics, the lower molecular weight fractions 3–10 kDa and <3 kDa showed protection against oxidation of fish oil to the same extent as caseinophosphopeptides. The oxygen content of the yoghurt was also found to be lower than that of milk. Thus our findings suggests that the higher oxidative stability of yoghurt might be due to antioxidant peptides released during the fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and/or by the lower oxygen content of yoghurt, which subsequently reduces the oxidative stress of fish oil incorporated in the yoghurt. The results show that antioxidant peptides may be used as an ingredient in foods enriched with fish oils to increase their oxidative stability.",10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.067,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant,,207424.8907,1070241.375,186329.6875,207424.8907,628285.5313

Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine αS1-casein (αS1-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and β-CN f58-76; ovine αS1-CN f1-6 and αS2-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine β-CN f58-65 and αS2-CN f182-187; buffalo β-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human β-CN. A mixture of peptides with a C-terminal sequence, Pro-Gly-Pro, was found in the most active fraction of the pig sodium caseinate hydrolysate. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity of some peptides corresponded to the concentration of the ACE inhibitor (S)-N-(1-[ethoxycarbonyl]-3-phenylpropyl)-ala-pro maleate (enalapril) of 49.253 μg/ml (100 μmol/liter). Several of the above sequences had features in common with other ACE-inhibitory peptides reported in the literature. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of some of the crude peptide fractions was very low (16 to 100 μg/ml). Some identified peptides were chemically synthesized, and the ACE-inhibitory activity and IC50s were confirmed. An antibacterial peptide corresponding to β-CN f184-210 was identified in human sodium caseinate hydrolysate. It showed a very large spectrum of inhibition against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including species of potential clinical interest, such as Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC for E. coli F19 was ca. 50 μg/ml. Once generated, the bioactive peptides were resistant to further degradation by proteinase of L. helveticus PR4 or by trypsin and chymotrypsin.; 2) The thermolysin catalysed hydrolysates of α-lactalbumin and β-casein were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) in order to identify the peptides responsible for the high ACE-inhibitory activity of these hydrolysates. The SEC fractionation separated many co-eluting peptides into different fractions allowing individual peptides to be isolated in one or two subsequent semi-preparative RP-HPLC fractionation steps. Five potent ACE-inhibitory peptides from α-lactalbumin were isolated. They all contained the C-terminal sequence -PEW, corresponding to amino acid residues 24–26 in α-lactalbumin, and had IC50 values of 1–5 μm. From one SEC fraction of the β-casein hydrolysate two potent ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated and identified as f58-76 and f59-76 of β-casein A2. They both contained IPP as the C-terminal sequence and had IC50 values of 4 and 5 μm. From another SEC fraction a new but less ACE-inhibitory peptide from β-casein was identified (f192–196; LYQQP).; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2007.04.008; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011; 3) 10.1128/AEM.69.9.5297-5305.2003,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,,,,,,

Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Immunomodulatory,,,,,,

In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.; 2) Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was identified in milk proteins fermented with Lactobacillus (Lb.) helveticus NCC 2765 (Nestlé Culture Collection, Vers-chez-les-Blanc, Switzerland). Hydrolyzing sodium caseinate for 1 and 2 h inhibited ACE activity, as measured by an in vitro ACE inhibition test. The hydrolysates with the highest ACE inhibitory potential were fractionated by gel permeation chromatography and their low molecular weight fractions collected. These fractions were subsequently subfractionated by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several hydrophobic subfractions showed high ACE inhibitory potential, and their peptide composition was determined using an ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an elctrospray ionization source. Analysis of the low molecular weight fraction identified 14 peptides with known antihypertensive activity and 1 with previously described opioid activity. On the basis of the peptide composition of active subfractions, two potentially active novel sequences were defined, and the following synthetic peptides were synthesized:  FVAPFPEVFG (αS1 39−48), ENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 33−48), NENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 32−48), LNENLLRFFVAPFPEVFG (αS1 31−48), NLHLPLPLL (β 147−155), ENLHLPLPLL (β 146−155), and VENLHLPLPLL (β 145−155). The ACE inhibitory potential of these synthetic peptides was assessed, and IC50 values were determined.

They also contain bioactive peptides, health-promoting compounds studied for a wide range of effects. In this work, several antioxidant peptides extracted from fermented milk proteins were investigated. First, enriched peptide fractions were purified and analysed for their antioxidant capacity in vitro and in a cellular model. Subsequently, from the most active fractions, 23 peptides were identified by mass spectrometry MS/MS), synthesized and tested. Peptides N-15-M, E-11-F, Q-14-R and A-17-E were selected for their antioxidant effects on Caco-2 cells both in the protection against oxidative stress and inhibition of ROS production. To define their action mechanism, the activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Keap1/Nrf2) pathway was studied evaluating the translocation of Nrf2 from cytosol to nucleus. In cells treated with N-15-M, Q-14-R and A-17-E, a higher amount of Nrf2 was found in the nucleus with respect to the control. In addition, the three active peptides, through the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, led to overexpression and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes.

In the present investigation, peptides, VLPVPQ and VLPVP were generated from parent antioxidative peptide, VLPVPQK. Initially, all these peptides were studied in-silico for biophysical properties like hydrophobicity, structure, Extinction coefficient, isoelectric point, grand average hydropathy value and Wimley White whole residue hydrophobicity. Inspite of this, homology relationship among organisms, taxonomy, digestibility assessment for proteases, solubility, melting temperature index, half-life time in-vitro and in-vivo, instability index and aliphatic index was compared in-silico. Further, based on these properties, VLPVP was compared with parent peptide, VLPVPQK for antioxidative potential. VLPVP exhibited lesser antioxidative potential by chemical method and in-vitro hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress conditions generated in fibroblast cells compared to VLPVPQK. The proliferative potential, cell injury marker, nitric oxide production and pro-inflammatory, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α was measured to compare cytoprotective antioxidative potential. The results displayed the cytoprotective potential of VLPVPQK. In addition, the present study suggested that glutamine and lysine are responsible for the c-terminal sequence based response and cytoprotective potential of milk bioactive peptide, VLPVPQK. Other than this, hydrophobic amino acids and positive charge of the VLPVPQK is also responsible for the cytoprotective potential.; 2) Bioactive peptides have been defined as specific protein fragments that have a positive impact on body functions or conditions and may ultimately influence health. We scrutinised the antioxidative property of peptides from buffalo casein digested with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin alone and in combinations. Casein hydrolysates were subjected to ultrafiltration followed by reversed phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The antioxidant properties of casein, its hydrolysates and synthetic peptides, was assessed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid). The fraction with highest Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) was selected for further study. TEAC of casein was 0.862 ± 0.11 μmol mg−1, while it is highest for pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates. The 1 kDa permeate of pepsin-trypsin hydrolysates possessed the highest antioxidant activity and it was resolved into 16 fractions by RP-HPLC. Antioxidant activity fraction 11 was highest and on custom sequencing yielded 4 peptides, of which the synthetic peptide VLPVPQK possessed the highest TEAC (5.71 ± 0.59 μmol mg−1).; 3) Bioactive peptides are relevant nutritional factors that exhibit many functions including antioxidant, antihypertensive, anticancer and antimicrobial properties. In this paper, four synthetic peptides ARHPHPHLSFM (A-11-M), AVPYPQR (A-7-R), NPYVPR (N-6-R) and KVLPVPEK (K-8-K) with sequences present in milk proteins were examined for their antioxidant properties. The compounds show moderate free radical scavenging activity in the ABTS and crocin assays (A-7-R and N-6-R) and lipid peroxidation inhibition in Caco-2 cells (N-6-R and K-8-K). All peptides, in particular K-8-K, activate the Keap1-Nrf2 system by allowing the translocation of the transcription factor Nrf2 from the cytosol to nucleus. This activation triggers the overexpression of the antioxidant enzymes Trx1, TrxR1, GR, NQO1 and SOD1. Furthermore, molecular modeling shows that K-8-K is able to hinder the interaction of Nrf2 with Keap1. The reported results show that the antioxidant action in cells of these bioactive peptides is mostly due to the activation of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.; 4) The antioxidant activity of caseins and casein-derived peptides was evaluated by using three free radical producing reactionsthe lipoxygenase- and AAPH-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid and the hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Caseins and casein-derived peptides were able to inhibit enzymatic and nonenzymatic lipid peroxidation, suggesting they were preferred targets for the free radical intermediates. The antioxidative feature was not lost with the dephosphorylation or the proteolysis of the proteins. The fractionation of the tryptic β-casein digest yielded peptides with antioxidant activity. A structure−function relationship between the amino acid sequence and the antioxidant capacity and effectiveness is proposed. In addition, indirect evidence suggested that the trapping of free radicals by the proteins/peptides was accompanied by the oxidation of proteins/peptides, according to a sequence-specific mechanism.; 5) Milk and milk-derived products are a relevant source of bioactive peptides, which are also potential components of functional foods. Bioactive peptides exert multiple actions including an antioxidant role. In the present paper, four synthetic peptides (NPYVPR, AVPYPQR, KVLPVPEK, and ARHPHPHLSFM), corresponding to milk-derived peptides were studied. Although with different features, as revealed by RP-HPLC chromatography and MS analysis, the obtained peptides were shown to be taken up by Caco-2 cells arranged in an epithelial monolayer formation. The four peptides were all able to preserve cell viability against induced oxidative stress indicating that they might have a role in the control of oxidative stress. Therefore, an estimation of total thiols and glutathione content was performed after cell treatment with oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TbOOH). The peptides were able to prevent the decrease of both total thiols and glutathione induced by H2O2 or TbOOH, and, in addition, they showed a protective effect on the thiol-related antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase. Finally, they caused a decrease of ROS production induced by TbOOH in Caco-2 cells. The reported results highlight the relevant antioxidant role played by bioactive peptides in cells, which adds to other previously known properties.",1) 10.1016/j.lwt.2019.108816; 2) 10.1021/jf0003911; 3) 10.1039/c7fo01646h; 4) 10.1016/j.jff.2019.103696; 5) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2014.11.001,sequence,IDENTITY,Antioxidant; Osteoanabolic; ACE-inhibitory; Antiapoptotic effect; Antimicrobial; Wound healing; Immunomodulatory,1929253.656,1474423.875,2218866.75,2010301.766,1734326.607,2079823.427

Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures.

Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant,1120313.75,,,,1120313.75,

In addition, NPWDQ (Asn-Pro-Trp-Asp-Gln, aa 107-111 of αs2-casein) was isolated from EMC and identified as one of the responsible peptides for this inhibitory activity (Tanabe et al., J. Agric. Food Chem., (2007)). In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism by which NPWDQ inhibited allergen permeation in vitro, and also to evaluate the effects of EMC on allergen permeation in vivo. Intestinal permeability for both fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated dextran and horseradish peroxidase was decreased in Caco-2 cells by the addition of NPWDQ, indicating that NPWDQ might inhibit both paracellular and transcellular transports. Next, intestinal inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injections of indomethacin to rats. When OVA was injected into the jejunal and ileac loops of indomethacin-administered rats with and without NPWDQ, it was found that the addition of NPWDQ effectively diminished OVA permeation from both loops. Although the plasma OVA concentration of indomethacin-administered rats after oral OVA challenge was markedly elevated over that of normal rats, supplemental administration of EMC to the rats effectively suppressed OVA permeation. These results suggest that EMC is useful for the prevention of food allergy by inhibiting allergen permeation probably by enforcing the intestinal barrier.",10.1271/bbb.80042,sequence,IDENTITY,Immunomodulatory,837615.5155,7131146.125,5517367.813,10436403.28,4613733.881,8796724.792

The susceptibility to the brush-border peptidases and route of transepithelial transport were observed to be the primary factors influencing the transport of these peptides. The apical to basal transport mechanism was studied using bradykinin as control as it shows resistance to cellular peptidases and its route of transepithelial transport had been established. VLPVPQK and BCM 5 were hydrolyzed by cellular peptidases while bradykinin was found intact. The transport of VLPVPQK (1.0%) was found to be relatively much higher than BCM 5 (0.03%) and bradykinin (0.1%). Interestingly the effect of some inhibitors on the transport of VLPVPQK suggested involvement of PepT1 like transporters/SOPT2 while BCM 5, its hydrolytic product and bradykinin were suggested to be transported mainly via the intracellular transcytosis pathway.; 2) Many types of bioactive peptides that inhibit angiotensin I, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) and Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) in the cardiovascular system contribute to the prevention and treatment of hypertension. These inhibitory peptides are derived from many food proteins or artificial synthetic products. Further research examining the bioavailability of ACE inhibitory peptides will lead to the development of more effective ACE inhibitory peptides and foods. Our research also demonstrates that ACE inhibitory peptide LAP may lower blood pressure with no adverse effects.; 3) Casein hydrolysate, produced by an extracellular proteinase from Lactobacillus helveticus CP790, was fractionated by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. Only one fraction showed antihypertensive activity as measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration. Ten peptides in the fraction were further purified and identified by analysis of amino acid sequences. Each identified peptide was chemically synthesized, and the antihypertensive activity of each peptide was evaluated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The synthetic peptide with a sequence of Lys-Val-Leu-Pro-Val-Pro-Gln, found in beta-casein, indicated strong antihypertensive activity from 2 to 10 h after oral administration of 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration (-31.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg). Moreover, the antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the dosage of peptide from 0.5 to 2 mg of peptide/kg of BW. Interestingly, the antihypertensive peptide showed lower inhibitory activity of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, but the activity was increased after pancreatin digestion.; 4) The possible roles of caseins as exorphins, immunostimulants and hypotensive agents have recently been suggested by several groups. In an attempt to prove the existence and to elucidate the physiological significance of peptide inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in milk proteins, we synthesized a total of 69 peptide fragments of human ^-casein, in which a proline residue was placed at the C-terminus for the ACE inhibitory activity. It was found that the peptides with potent inhibitory activity in vitro were located in the region of amino acid residues 39 ~ 52 of human p- casein. All the peptides within this sequence (39~52) had potent ACE inhibitory activity. The most potent inhibitor was a decapeptide, Ser-Phe-Gln-Pro-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ile-Tyr-Pro (IC50 = 1.4 μm), which was also active in vivo.; 5) An optimal antihypertensive peptide (AHP), KVLPVP, was linked to form a six-copy of tandem dotetracontapeptide with the specific cleavage site (Arg-X) of clostripain. The gene of the dotetracontapeptide was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. After a 5 h induction with 1.2 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside the recombinant AHP fused with glutathione-S-transferase tag reached the maximal production, 24.6% of total intracellular protein. Following digestion with clostripain and carboxypeptidase B, the product was separated with ultrafiltration and reversed-phase HPLC, and 170 mg of pure recombinant AHP was obtained from 1 L of E. coli culture. The IC50 of the recombinant AHP was 4.6 microM. The systolic blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats could be decreased dramatically by the recombinant AHP in a dose-dependent manner after delivering 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of body weight (BW) or 0.6 mg of AHP/kg of BW orally. The strong antihypertensive effect was reached 4-24 h after oral administration of 0.3 mg of AHP/kg of BW, and the peak point was at the fourth hour (-21.4 +/- 7.2 mm of Hg). This study overcame traditional enzymatic digestion problems in preparing AHP and established a novel approach for industrial production of AHP.; 6) Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products and have the potential to confer bioactivity relevant to cardiovascular health, as they possess extensive proteolytic systems that liberate small bioactive peptides from larger milk proteins. Certain casein-derived peptides released by various LAB strains during fermentation have been shown to reduce hypertension and to modulate the immune system. We investigated the growth and peptide production of 2 LAB strains, Lactobacillus helveticus R0389 and Lactocaseibacillus rhamnosus R0011, their immunomodulatory activities, as well as their abilities to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Peptide fractions collected from the cell-free supernatant of both medium-grown and milk fermentation cultures were assessed for ACE-inhibitory activity and their effects on the production of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines by human THP-1 monocytes. Cultures were grown in medium, with or without supplementation with 0.1% casein, or in 3.25% milk fermented with each LAB strain. Casein supplementation increased the growth rate of both LAB strains, and significantly increased ACE-inhibitory activity of peptide fractions collected from both L. helveticus R0389 and L. rhamnosus R0011 cultures grown for 12 h. Fermentation peptide fractions of L. rhamnosus R0011 showed comparable ACE-inhibitory activity to known ACE inhibiting peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (up to 79% inhibition) with a significant difference between culture peptide fractions and acidified and nonacidified control fractions collected after 6 d of fermentation. Many milk and casein-derived peptides reported in previous studies have been identified as part of a larger bioactive fraction. We synthesized a group of these peptides to individually assess both ACE-inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The known ACE inhibitors Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro showed similar ACE inhibition to previously published results, while also inducing the production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by monocytes in the presence and absence of a proinflammatory stimulant. These synthesized peptides could also induce the production of nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, in human endothelial cell cultures. Investigating the relationships among these bioactive properties could improve the use of probiotic organisms and their secreted products in the food industry.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(96)76487-1; 2) 10.1021/jf0703248; 3) 10.1016/j.foodchem.2015.05.121; 4) 10.1016/j.peptides.2008.02.005; 5) 10.1080/00021369.1989.10869621; 6) 10.3168/jds.2019-17976,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant; Osteoanabolic; Antiapoptotic effect; Antimicrobial; Wound healing; Immunomodulatory; DPP-IV Inhibitory; Cholesterol regulation,356082204,930979190.1,1099207700,1063717102,602466626.6,1078927358

Milk provides a wide range of bioactive substances, such as antimicrobial peptides and proteins. Our study aimed to identify novel antimicrobial peptides naturally present in milk.
Methods and results

The components of an endogenous bovine milk peptide database were virtually screened for charge, amphipathy, and predicted secondary structure. Thus, 23 of 248 screened peptides were identified as candidates for antimicrobial effects. After commercial synthesis, their antimicrobial activities were determined against Escherichia coli NEB5α, E. coli ATCC25922, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC6051. In the tested concentration range (<2 mM), bacteriostatic activity of 14 peptides was detected including nine peptides inhibiting both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The most effective fragment was TKLTEEEKNRLNFLKKISQRYQKFΑLPQYLK corresponding to αS2-casein151–181, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4.0 μM against B. subtilis ATCC6051, and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 16.2 μM against both E. coli strains. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed conformational changes of most active peptides in a membrane-mimic environment, transitioning from an unordered to α-helical structure.
Conclusion

Screening of food peptide databases by prediction tools is an efficient method to identify novel antimicrobial food-derived peptides. Milk-derived antimicrobial peptides may have potential use as functional food ingredients and help to understand the molecular mechanisms of anti-infective milk effects.",10.1002/mnfr.201500182,sequence,IDENTITY,Antimicrobial,,39171.94141,,,39171.94141,

Prior to the assay, the 3,000-Da permeate from 45-d-old cheeselike systems was fractionated by tandem chromatographic techniques. Several peaks were obtained in each chromatogram, but only some were associated with ACE-inhibitory or antioxidant activity or both. Peptides Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro, Val-Pro-Lys-Val-Lys, and Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-Val-Leu-Gly-Pro-* from β-casein, as well as Arg-Pro-Lys and Arg-Pro-Lys-His-Pro-Ile-Lys-His-* from αs1-casein exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity. Peptides released upon cleavage of the peptide bond Leu190-Tyr191 (either in ovine or caprine β-casein), and corresponding to the β-casein sequence Tyr-Gln-Glu-Pro-*, possessed antioxidant activity.; 2) The resistance of six casein-derived peptides, including antihypertensive peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL and YQKFPQY, to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and the effect on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were evaluated. After digestion, peptides RYLGY, AYFYPEL, and YQKFPQY were partly hydrolysed by the digestive enzymes. RYLGY and AYFYPEL maintained potent ACE-inhibitory activity, with IC50 values as low as 9.3 and 4.7 μg mL−1, respectively. Digestion fragments were sequenced and then synthesised to evaluate their activity. Several showed potent ACE-inhibitory activity, which could explain the in vitro activity of the digests. A notable antioxidant activity was also observed. Since AYFYPEL was less susceptible to digestion, we focused on the antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats of the main digestion fragments of RYLGY. Interestingly, these peptides showed moderate effects in vivo. This suggests that the undigested fraction could also contribute to the in vivo effects of RYLGY and AYFYPEL, and other minor fragments may also participate.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72370-0; 2) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2013.05.008,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antioxidant,85187758.38,111351852.5,133310173.1,87879709.18,96400941.58,107349908

ACE-inhibition activity was observed only after the digestion of proteins with pepsin and trypsin. Whey proteins resulted in 35–61% inhibition and caseins 86% inhibition under the applied conditions. The hydrolysates having inhibitory activity were fractionated by size exclusion and reversed phase chromatography. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were purified and identified by amino acid and MS-analysis. The identified peptides were α-la f105–110, β-lg f9–14, f15–20, αs1-cn f142–147, f157–164, f194–199 and β-cn f108–113, f177–183 and 193–198. Among whey hydrolysates peptides with small molecular weight (<1000 Da) were the most active inhibitors. The highest ACE-inhibitory activity was found in the peptides derived from αs1-casein.; 2) The fragment-peptides of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI12, CEI5 and CEIβ7) derived from an enzymatic hydrolysate of casein were synthesized. Val-Ala-Pro, the C-terminal tripeptide of CEI5 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro), exhibited more potent inhibitory activity (I50 = 2.0μm) than CEI5 (I50 = 6.0μm). However, d-Val-Ala-Pro showed lower inhibitory activity (I50 = 550μm). Val-Ala-Pro may be important for the inhibitory activity of CEI5. The C-terminal heptapeptide of CEI12 (Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro-Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys) and the short fragments of CEIβ7 (Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg) showed lower inhibitory activities than the full-length peptides.

Also, the antihypertensive activity of CEI12 and CEI5 was investigated. CEI12, intravenously administered to anesthetized rats at 14.2 mg/kg, antagonized the rats’ pressor response to angiotensin I.; 3) Inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme were isolated from an enzymatic hydrolysate of bovine casein. The amino acid sequences of these inhibitors were Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro-Phe-Pro- Glu-Val-Phe-Gly-Lys (CEI12), Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (CEI5), and Ala-Val-Pro-Tyr-Pro-Gln-Arg (CEIβ7). CEI5 is a penta-peptide derived from the hydrolysate of CEI12 with proline-specific endopeptidase, and CEIβ7 is a hepta-peptide derived from β-casein. These inhibitors potentiated bradykinin in the contraction of the uterus and the ileum of rats. The ileum was more sensitive to these inhibitors than the uterus. The bradykinin-potentiating activity of these inhibitors on the ileum lasted for more than 90 min even after washing the organ.",1) 10.1080/00021369.1985.10866901; 2) 10.1080/00021369.1987.10868244; 3) 10.1016/S0958-6946(98)00048-X,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antimicrobial; Antioxidant; DPP-IV Inhibitory,561590650,438863971.3,736117061.3,503274553.3,508993502,603064199.6

The crude 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate exhibited ACE-inhibitory activity of 85.51% (±15%) and had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.8 mg protein/ml compared to captopril, which had an IC50 value of 0.005 mg/ml. Fractionation of the crude L. animalis DPC6134 fermentate by membrane filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) generated three bioactive fractions from a total of 72 fractions. Fractions 10, 19, and 43 displayed ACE-inhibitory activity percentages of 67.53 (±15), 83.71 (±19), and 42.36 (±11), respectively, where ACE inhibition was determined with 80 μl of the fractions with protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml. HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis identified 25 distinct peptide sequences derived from α-, β-, and κ-caseins. In silico predictions, based on the C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences, suggested that peptide NIPPLTQTPVVVPPFIQ, corresponding to β-casein f(73-89); peptide IGSENSEKTTMP, corresponding to αs1-casein f(201212); peptide SQSKVLPVPQ, corresponding to β-casein f(166-175); peptide MPFPKYPVEP, corresponding to β-casein f(124133); and peptide EPVLGPVRGPFP, corresponding to β-casein f(210-221), contained ACE-inhibitory activities. These peptides were chosen for chemical synthesis to confirm the ACE-inhibitory activity of the fractions. Chemically synthesized peptides displayed IC50 values in the range of 92 μM to 790 μM. Additionally, a simulated gastrointestinal digestion confirmed that the ACE-inhibitory 10-kDa L. animalis DPC6134 fermentation was resistant to a cocktail of digestive enzymes found in the gastrointestinal tract.; 2) Previous studies have demonstrated that milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis decreases the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we evaluated the antihypertensive activity of the following peptide sequences: LHLPLP, LHLPLPL, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV. These peptides isolated from E. faecalis-fermented milk showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory activity. Because the most potent angiotensin I-converting enzyme-inhibitory sequences were LHLPLP and LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, we administered different doses of these peptides to spontaneously hypertensive rats. High doses of the remaining sequences were also administered to these animals. Water served as a negative control and captopril as a positive control. All products were administered orally. The SBP and DBP were measured before administration and also at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after administration. Before administration of the different products, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed SBP and DBP values of 218 ± 2.5 and 157 ± 5.9 mmHg, respectively (n = 30). The sequences LHLPLP, LVYPF-PGPIPNSLPQNIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV caused clear and significant decreases in SBP, DBP, or both in the animals. In particular, the antihypertensive effect could be clearly established when 2 or 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP was administered. These 2 doses of LHLPLP showed similar antihypertensive properties. Four hours after administration of captopril or the highest doses of the different peptides, the decreases in the SBP and the DBP (mmHg) were as follows: captopril (SBP = 52 ± 5.8, DBP = 38.8 ± 3.8), 3 mg/kg of LHLPLP (SBP = 25.3 ± 8.2, DBP = 29.5 ± 7.6), 6 mg/kg of LVYPFPGPIP-NSLPQNIPP (SBP = 14.9 ± 3.7, DBP = 8.7 ± 4.4), 10 mg/kg of LHLPLPL (SBP = 7.7 ± 4.1, DBP = 9.4 ± 3.1), 10 mg/kg of VLGPVRGPFP (SBP = 16.2 ± 5.8, DBP = 21.64 ± 3.2), and 10 mg/kg of VRGPFPIIV (SBP = 16.05 ± 2.74, DBP = 9.19 ± 3.49). The results obtained suggest that the sequences LHLPLP, LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQ-NIPP, VLGPVRGPFP, and VRGPFPIIV could be responsible, at least in part, for the antihypertensive properties described for E. faecalis-fermented milk.; 3) Several novel peptides with demonstrated antihypertensive activity have been identified in milk fermented with Enterococcus faecalis CECT 5727. Two of the identified peptides, corresponding to β-casein f(133–138) (LHLPLP) and β-casein f(58–76) (LVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPP), showed angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) activity (IC50) values as low as 5 μm. These peptides demonstrated antihypertensive activity when they were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. In particular, β-casein f(133–138), yielded a significant antihypertensive effect in these animals. The maximal decreases in systolic blood pressure (21.87±4.51 mmHg, ) and diastolic blood pressure (28.5±3.20 mmHg, ) were observed 4 and 2 h, respectively, after the administration of 2 mg kg−1 of this peptide. The presence of these antihypertensive peptides in fermented milk prepared with other selected strains of E. faecalis (CECT 5728, 5826 and 5827) was confirmed by HPLC-MS.",1) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(06)72372-4; 2) 10.1128/AEM.00096-07; 3) 10.1016/j.idairyj.2005.12.011,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory,218019.7188,465772.2422,,902921.5472,341895.9805,902921.5472

The models were then employed to help predict the potential of peptides, which are currently reported in the literature to be present in the intestinal tract of humans following milk/dairy product ingestion, to act as inhibitors of DPP-IV. Two models (z- and v-scale) for short (2–5 amino acid residues) bovine milk peptides, behaving as competitive inhibitors of DPP-IV, were developed. The z- and the v-scale models (p < 0.05, R2 of 0.829 and 0.815, respectively) were then applied to 56 milk protein-derived peptides previously reported in the literature to be found in the intestinal tract of humans which possessed a structural feature of DPP-IV inhibitory peptides (P at the N2 position). Ten of these peptides were synthetized and tested for their in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory properties. There was no agreement between the predicted and experimentally determined DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for the competitive peptide inhibitors. However, the ranking for DPP-IV inhibitory potency of the competitive peptide inhibitors was conserved. Furthermore, potent in vitro DPP-IV inhibitory activity was observed with two peptides, LPVPQ (IC50 = 43.8 ± 8.8 μM) and IPM (IC50 = 69.5 ± 8.7 μM).

The antihypertensive effect of casein hydrolysates in strain SHR spontaneously hypertensive rats was also investigated. Both alpha s1- and beta-casein hydrolysates inhibited this enzyme. Some of these peptides showed enzyme inhibitory activity, and one of them from beta-casein inhibited the enzyme greatly; the concentration of an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor needed to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity was 4 microM. The hydrolysate of casein demonstrated antihypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats at an orally administered dosage of 15 mg/kg of body weight. MILK fermented with L. helveticus CP790, containing about .3% peptides, also showed antihypertensive activity in SHR rats with 5 ml/kg of body weight (15 mg of peptide/kg); however, the milk fermented with L. helveticus CP791, a variant defective for proteinase activity, did not show this activity. Results suggested that the peptides liberated from casein by the proteinase in the culture medium showed antihypertensive effect in SHR rats.; 2) Bioactive peptides, including angiotensin-I-converting enzyme-inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, were investigated in commercially produced Wisconsin Cheddar cheeses that ranged in age from ≤6 d to more than 2 yr. The ACEI activity of cheese was determined in water-soluble extracts (WSE) that were fractionated for components with molecular weight (MW) ≤3,000 Da, and peptides identified using HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry. The number of types of bioactive peptides increased with an increase in ripening time. Six of the identified ACEI peptides, Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP), Val-Pro-Pro (VPP), Glu-Lys-Asp-Glu-Arg-Phe (EKDERF), Val-Arg-Tyr-Leu (VRYL), Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ile-Pro-Asn (YPFPGPIPN), and Phe-Phe-Val-Ala-Pro (FFVAP), with known high ACEI activity (low IC50 values, the concentration needed to inhibit ACE to 50% of its original activity) were synthesized and used to quantify the amounts of these peptides in various cheese extracts. The concentrations of these 6 ACEI peptides increased up to a certain stage of ripening. The maximum contents of IPP, VPP, and EKDERF were 2.8, 7.4, and 5.3 mg/100 g of cheese, respectively, and these levels were found in a 1-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample. The maximum content of VRYL (7.5 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 2-yr-old Cheddar cheese sample, whereas the maximum content of YPFPGPIPN (6.8 mg/100 g of cheese) was found in a 6-mo-old Cheddar cheese sample. Trace amounts of FFVAP were found in these cheeses. Aged Cheddar cheese was found to be a rich source of ACEI peptides even though large differences exist between cheeses from different manufacturers.",1) 10.3168/jds.2015-9569; 2) 10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(94)77026-0,sequence,IDENTITY,ACE-inhibitory; Antimicrobial; Immunomodulatory; Anticancer; Antithrombotic,,,,,,

The αs1-casein tryptic hydrolysate containing this peptide decreases stress effects after oral administration in various species including man. Therefore, the stability of this peptide toward gastric and pancreatic proteases has been assessed by using pepsin, chymotrypsin/trypsin, Corolase PP, pepsin followed by chymotrypsin/trypsin or pepsin followed by Corolase PP. α-Casozepine was slowly degraded by chymotrypsin, much more sensitive to pepsin and Corolase PP but not completely destroyed after 4 h kinetics. The bonds in the region 91 to 95 of the α-casozepine were totally resistant to hydrolysis by all studied proteases. Surprisingly, a fragment, corresponding to the sequence 91−97 and found in all the hydrolysis media in significant amount, possessed an anxiolytic activity in three behavioral tests measuring this parameter. This peptide could participate in the in vivo activity of α-casozepine.; 2) α-Casozepine and f91–97, peptides from αs1-casein, display anxiolytic activity in rats and may have to cross the intestinal epithelium to exert this central effect. We evaluated their resistance to hydrolysis by the peptidases of Caco-2 cells and their ability to cross the cell monolayer. To mimic physiological conditions, two preparations of bile salts were used in noncytotoxic concentrations: porcine bile extract and an equimolar mixture of taurocholate, cholate, and deoxycholate. The presence and composition of bile salts appeared to modulate the peptidase activities of the Caco-2 cells involved (i) in the hydrolysis of α-casozepine, leading to much higher formation of fragments f91–99, f91–98, and f91–97, and (ii) in the hydrolysis of f91–97, leading to lower degradation of this peptide. Transport of α-casozepine across Caco-2 monolayer increased significantly, in the presence of bile extract, and of fragment f91–97, in the presence of bile salts.",1) 10.1021/jf104089c; 2) 10.1021/jf202890e,sequence,IDENTITY,Antianxiety; Anticancer; Antioxidant; Increase mucin secretion; Opioid; ACE-inhibitory,2750498,1206174.906,123451.3789,413105.4974,2132768.763,297243.85
