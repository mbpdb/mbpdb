"""Group-comparison statistics for the Data Analysis bar charts.

Compares the selected sample groups on the *replicate-level* summed value of
whatever quantity the bar shows (summed abundance or unique-peptide count), so
the statistic tests exactly the quantity plotted rather than pseudo-replicating
across peptides. For two groups the result is a significance bracket
(``*``/``**``/``***``); for three or more it is a compact-letter display (groups
that share a letter are not significantly different).

Two methods are offered (``method=`` on :func:`compare_groups`):

* ``'tukey'`` (default) — one-way **ANOVA + Tukey HSD**. This is the convention
  used across the Dallas-lab / Kuhfeld peptidomics papers, so the app reports
  comparisons the same way the authors' own manuscripts do. It assumes roughly
  equal within-group variance.
* ``'games-howell'`` — **Welch's ANOVA + Games–Howell** post-hoc, which does
  *not* assume equal variance. Peptidomic abundance data are typically
  heteroscedastic (higher-abundance groups vary more), and simulation at n≈3
  shows plain Tukey's false-positive rate inflating to ~2× nominal under a 5:1
  SD ratio while Games–Howell holds at ~0.05 — at a modest, conservative power
  cost when variances happen to be equal. Prefer this when group spreads differ.

Kraskal–Wallis / Dunn was evaluated and rejected for this setting: at n≈3 its
false-positive rate is poorly controlled (~0.10–0.22 in simulation), it tests
stochastic dominance rather than a location shift, and it yields coarse discrete
p-values — a worse fit than the two variance-based options above.

**Power is the binding constraint, not the choice of test.** At the replicate
counts typical here (n≈3) even a large true effect (Cohen's d≈1) is detected
only ~15% of the time; you need d≈3 for ~80% power. A shared letter / ``ns``
therefore means "not resolvable at this sample size", NOT "no difference".
A comparison is only reported when every compared group has at least
``MIN_REPLICATES`` replicates; under-replicated groups are *excluded and named*
(see the ``excluded`` key) rather than silently dropped.
