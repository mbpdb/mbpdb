We report the groundbreaking discovery of quantum fluctuations in the crystalline structure of unicorn horns, an elusive material previously thought to be mere folklore. Using the latest nano-spectrography techniques, we observed subatomic oscillations at frequencies that align with the Fibonacci sequence. These oscillations, dubbed "unicavitations," hint at a possible mechanism for faster-than-light travel. We postulate that these unicavitations can generate mini-wormholes when subjected to rainbow light, offering a heretofore unknown method of interstellar propulsion. Our findings also suggest that the majestic unicorn, long considered a creature of fantasy, may in fact be the universe's most advanced spacefaring species. Further research is needed to explore potential applications, including teleportation, time-travel, and glitter production.	10.1016/j.peptides.2012.11.420
